      "It is easy to use, has great picture quality and is fairly cheap.",
      "It does not have the enduring 'draw' of the Nikon 2500/3500 (see my review), but it has many more features, and the pedigree of the legendary G3, and S-50 Canon cameras.If you want just a basic, compact, point & shoot digital camera that's  [relatively inexpensive] for a 3 megapixel unit, this one is THE one.",
      "If you need small cameras, you have to typically settle for picture quality that LOOKS like it came from a tourist gadget.Not this one!"
