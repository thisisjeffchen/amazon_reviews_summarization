in a parking garage while i certainly don't want to give anyone a false sense"", ""the only reason to buy this over priced junk is if you want fix the main design defect of the palm v it turns itself on if you push any of the 4 buttons on the bottom of the palm if you buy this case cut off the back and drill 4 holes thru the front then you can a hot sync b keep your v in a pocket without it turning on and draining the battery i'd say you should save your money"", 'how much would you spend to protect your palm this case looks real good and it fits your palm like a glove adds very little additional weight and gives you the mental peace that your palm will be protected from about everything it could happen to it leather may look more stylish but they are also bulky a great buy', 'the palm v is both fabulously practical and stylish however this case feels and looks cheap with this case the pilot ceases to be stylish and becomes as bulky as the palm iii', ""at first i was surprised that the case did not close entirely all the way it just shuts close but there's no locking system the spring on the hinges feel like they are going to give away after 6 months or so the front half of case is already showing a bit loosening in the springs where as the back half is holding pretty well had for 3 months i was originally going to get the coach case but decided on this since i don't have to deal with zippers and such i also liked the way the case looks"", 'i was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first afterall it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum <OOV> on it i no longer have doubts i have unintentionally dropped my palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces brick hard wood floor etc and both the case and more importantly the palm itself have come out completely unscathed so my advice is if you are looking for real protection for your investment just get one of these there is no need to spend more on a titanium box from <OOV> skin or any of the

kind of strap that i haven't seen since i got a cheap slr in the early 1980s completely pointless unusable in my opinion and the first thing i would advise is to go buy the strap support system of your choice and don't"", ""these were given as a gift the instruction manual is a general guide and contains no specifications particular to this binocular the magnification of 16x is a nice idea but too much to accommodate a steady image when using these handheld without a very secure grip it will be necessary to prop them or mount them via the threads at the front of the focus mechanism and as
