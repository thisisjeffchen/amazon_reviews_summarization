  "I replaced my old center channel speaker with this one and am amazed at the quality of the sound.",
  "packaging was in good shape when delivered but speaker had damage at top left corner; so I would say it came from the factory like that, with that said my plan of buying Cerwin-Vega towers and rear speakers for a upgrade has just ended.",
  "I have a full theater system in my room now and it sounds fantastic, this was the last part of the speaker set I needed and it was an excellent choice.",
  "There is a reasonable amount of centre speakers out there in the market; but not many with this price tag and performance.It does what it was designed to and built nice.I was quite surprised to see how well the speaker was finished and how it performed once I had it hooked up.It can take a lot of high volumes and the vocals coming through are crisp and clear.It has Value for the cost of purchase.It can also run as surrounds if you bought a pair.Please note it is not a high end product and should not be compared with one.it has its own independent lure and should be appreciated that way.Buy it and you will enjoy it for what its potential is.",
  "I think if your in the market for a center that is under 18 Inches this is a solid choice.Not sure if I'd choose this for my Living Room Center-- But for a small room that I cant really crank it up anyway-- it sounds great..Side Note for my setup I have my crossover on my AVR set to 100 Hz and it sounds great.Update..Just uploaded 2 pics of the speaker.."
