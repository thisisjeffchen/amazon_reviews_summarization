      "Try experimenting with the features to find something that suits you.For the money, its a great camera, but dont expect miracles out of it.",
      "Although it is a bargain and not a bad camera, I found it too frustrating for regular use.",
      "In short, buy an Olympus, this camera was intended to replace the same and except for it's ability to shoot movies, it doesn't."
