  "Not a big deal.",

  "The only negative with the software was having to go into the Windows registry to get the serial number to qualify for the version updates--the manual walks you through this, and since I once had a job that required registry edits, this wasn't difficult, but I question how wise it is for Nero to make an average user dig into the Windows registry!You can get much better deals on internal burners, but if you need an external burner, particularly if you don't already have a software package for editing and burning DVDs, it would be hard to find a better deal than this drive.Aside: after staring at my Seagate hard drive and the Memorex burner side by side all last night, I was thinking I'd like to see some enterprising company bundle a large hard drive right on a DVD burner.",
  "I still haven't read the manual or installed a thing, and it continues to burn files in my iTunes folder and function with my iMac like it was made for that purpose.",
  "My computer is not fast enough for this recorder but it still does a remarkable job of recording and when I get a new computer I am sure we will have a great relationship.",
  "Nero application won't recognize the recorder if it is not connected during the software installation.Except for this minor problem the performance of the recorder is excellent.I had to get a program to convert format of existing audio file in the hard disc because Nero suite does not have this function.",
  "I might have deducted a star for the software included in the package (will not work with Vista and requires a PAID upgrade to a new version), but frankly I'd been made aware of that problem BEFORE making the purchase.The burner has thus far worked flawlessly with every disc I've thrown at it, including many that wouldn't work in any other burner I have."
