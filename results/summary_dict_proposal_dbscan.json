      "There is a reasonable amount of centre speakers out there in the market; but not many with this price tag and performance.It does what it was designed to and built nice.I was quite surprised to see how well the speaker was finished and how it performed once I had it hooked up.It can take a lot of high volumes and the vocals coming through are crisp and clear.It has Value for the cost of purchase.It can also run as surrounds if you bought a pair.Please note it is not a high end product and should not be compared with one.it has its own independent lure and should be appreciated that way.Buy it and you will enjoy it for what its potential is.",
      "With an arrangement as mine, or similar where there are discrete line-level outputs for the various channels, It is possible to insert a modest 5-band equalizer in the signal path (between the output of the OPPO center-channel and the input to the power amp) and use the equalizer to provide some &#34;sound tailoring&#34; to tone down a bit of the horn-like prominence - of course, this would only work where the discrete analog outputs are line-level and not speaker level.",
