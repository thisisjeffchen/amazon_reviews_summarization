Until, you start to relize the white balance photos with Fong are cool...Compared with another image taken with the WP (wide panel) on flash (that is the panel that flips down on your flash) and the catchlight panel up and the flash pointed at ceiling just like Fong does (to keep all equal in this comparison).Then I also took one without the panel on at all and bounced from ceiling.As you look at the images try not to read the captions to try and figure out which is the fong image and which is the flashes version of getting the same job done.I will tell you after the long review and working on this \"project\", it is NOT worth it... as you will be using this product in low light where you will need a strobe but, the problem is this strobe adds or makes the image cooler and you will have to increase your exposer to make up for this which will be a problem as the lighting changes if you are bouncing around a shoot with multiple existing ambient lighting setups.I suggest you save your money and learn to use your on flash \"deflector\" and wide panel that comes with most Canon flashes.Please, give me a thumbs up on this review as I did it for the Amazon photographers in mind and it took me some time.Thanks.UPDATE:  This is good for taking a closeup tabel shot of say, writing material or if the person is say, on the other side of a doorway where a bounce will NOT make it threw the doorway... then, I would say, this can have it's uses.",
