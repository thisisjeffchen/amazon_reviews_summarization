  "Have owned this camera for a few years.",
  "The camera has a good zoom on it, and is very easy to use.",
  "I do not enjoy carrying the larger movie cameras and this is just right for me.",
  "Personally I love it, but if you want to be able to zoom in on your subjects, definitely pony up the cash and move up to a more expensive camera.",
  "I can get at least 60 shots using these batteries with the camera in full function."

  "I also have a problem importing pictures directly from the camera to my graphics program, it will only allow for one picture at a time to be imported, this is the first camera that has done this to me.",
  "i got this camera a few years ago because i really like how their is a lens cover, it had a pretty good price for its features and it had a movie mode but i used norecharable bateries when i first got it you have to get 2500nah batteries for best results i recomend this camera for kids because its durable cheap easy to use and it dosn't have an optical zoom so the lens dosn't pop out which makes it easy to break  but i lost it a year and a half ago but now im geting the powershot 570is hopefully its good too i hope this was helpful",
  "Other than that the clarity is wonderful and once you've taken a read through of the manual you're good to go.I would recommend this for anyone young or anyone for a first digital camera.I'm planning on getting the rechargable battery pack as well as the AC adapter so that I don't have to get frustrated.",
  "I had a Fujidigital for the previous 5 years and it served me well for basicphotos, just a bit weak on the megapixs (1.3), and after the first couple of years; the controls became less dependable.The Canon A300 has easy-to-use controls, takes digital movies with sound, stitches several pictures together to make a panoramic print, takes gorgeous closeups within a few inches of subject and transfers the pictures to a pc or other device in a snap with a excellent photo program that allows cropping, editing, etc...There are drawbacks to this model - the digital telephoto isn't too good past 2.5X (goes up to 7.5x), no optical telephoto, uses AA alkaline batteries as if they were candy, the battery and compactflash card door isn't located right as I keep unlocking it when I turn the camera on with the protective lenscap that slides towards it.",
  "The picture quality is excellent, but I noticed that when you zoom to anything, the picture clarity diminishes a little, and at sometimes, depending on the conditions, can come out blurry.The good is that the camera is excellent for those people who go out and are the outdoors type person."
