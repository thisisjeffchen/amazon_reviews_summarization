{"B00008OE43": ["this camera is geared towards the casual photographer who is looking for good resolution (3MP) in a compact and lightweight package and doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a digicam.pros:- great resolution for the price - 3MP!- uses the same DIGIC processor as Canon's high-end G3 and EOS 10D - great pictures!- you can use this as a point and shoot but it still allows a degree of manual control when you want to be more creative with your shots- focus assist light for low-light situations- has exposure compensation- two autofocus modes- ISO 50-400 range- the interface makes plenty of useful features quickly accessible - once you get the hang of it- voice annotation available- VGA movie mode with sound (limited to 30 seconds)- uses non-proprietary AA batteries; i recommend buying rechargeables though- reasonable shot to shot time for this class of camera- USB connectivity- and you can get all this for less than a couple of c-notes!cons:- no optical zoom; but if that's what you want, you should look at the next class up on cameras (there's a digital zoom, but it's better to take the picture un-zoomed and zoom in later in your computer)- noticeable barrel distortion at the edges of the frame- the camera is light but it's bulky, so it doesn't feel very solid- no RAW or TIFF uncompressed format- short flash range- the included 16MB CF card is not enough; be prepared to shell out more $$ for more memory- no composite video connection so you can't view on a TVfor the price and for its target audience, this is a very nice camera.", "I did buy 4 energizer rechargables though, and each pair has lasted me a good 2 or 3 daysI strongly recommend using the viewfinder to take shots and use the lcd to review shots to save on battery.The digital zoom is not that good, but im surprised i can still catch the license plate of a car that almost hit me.The movie mode is ok.  its much better outdoors than indoorsThe memory card lasted a while, but i really wanted to get better shots, so I got the 128 mb card.", "Other than that the clarity is wonderful and once you've taken a read through of the manual you're good to go.I would recommend this for anyone young or anyone for a first digital camera.I'm planning on getting the rechargable battery pack as well as the AC adapter so that I don't have to get frustrated.", "I had a Fujidigital for the previous 5 years and it served me well for basicphotos, just a bit weak on the megapixs (1.3), and after the first couple of years; the controls became less dependable.The Canon A300 has easy-to-use controls, takes digital movies with sound, stitches several pictures together to make a panoramic print, takes gorgeous closeups within a few inches of subject and transfers the pictures to a pc or other device in a snap with a excellent photo program that allows cropping, editing, etc...There are drawbacks to this model - the digital telephoto isn't too good past 2.5X (goes up to 7.5x), no optical telephoto, uses AA alkaline batteries as if they were candy, the battery and compactflash card door isn't located right as I keep unlocking it when I turn the camera on with the protective lenscap that slides towards it.", "I didn't even need the manual until it came time to download the pictures from my camera onto my computer (which also turned out to be easy).The only thing that really bothers me is the very slow reaction time."], "B0007OWASE": ["The only negative with the software was having to go into the Windows registry to get the serial number to qualify for the version updates--the manual walks you through this, and since I once had a job that required registry edits, this wasn't difficult, but I question how wise it is for Nero to make an average user dig into the Windows registry!You can get much better deals on internal burners, but if you need an external burner, particularly if you don't already have a software package for editing and burning DVDs, it would be hard to find a better deal than this drive.Aside: after staring at my Seagate hard drive and the Memorex burner side by side all last night, I was thinking I'd like to see some enterprising company bundle a large hard drive right on a DVD burner.", "Not bad compared to what I have heard for some people.1)The burner is sleek, stable, and nicely built.2)It gives you step by step instructions on how to set it up, which is especially helpful if you are not computer savvy.3)If you open the NeroSmart Start, it's a user-friendly interface that helps you fine exactly what you want to do.HOWEVER there are a few things I dislike about the DVD burner, nothing major however.1)The tray seemed a tad wobbly.2)The software is a trial, it is really nice software but it's only a trail version and It costs $60 to get the full program, kind of upsetting...So far I think this is a great investment and I am very happy with it.", "I might have deducted a star for the software included in the package (will not work with Vista and requires a PAID upgrade to a new version), but frankly I'd been made aware of that problem BEFORE making the purchase.The burner has thus far worked flawlessly with every disc I've thrown at it, including many that wouldn't work in any other burner I have.", "The included Nero software is very user friendly, so you'll be making relatively professional looking DVD home movies (complete with custom menus and options) in no time.I only have 2 things to complain about on this package (one on the unit and one on the software), and they are just nit-picky little things.1.", "My system is an up to date Dell Dimension that only had ROM DVD and CDRdrive so I saw this unit that appeared to fill my needs  of for transfering some video shorts to DVD......I read the AMAZON PRODUCT DESCRIPTION  that stated ...\"comes with Nero Software THAT EASILY allows you TO BURN CDs and DVDS\".You can only burn CD Videos that will run on your (and others) computer.Data DVDs up to 4.7 GB - which is handy HOWEVER: It was not clear that in order to transfer any of your video files to real (run of mill DVD player type) DVDs you must upgrade to Nero 7 or  8 which is available for and extra $60...Be careful  if you want to make  \"real\" DVDs  go where  you can see thatNero 7 Essentials is included.... or upgrade to Nero 8....cause I don't believe you can get 7 any longer.Inexpensive  and VERY simple to get running....I did not need another DVD ROM or CD Burner at this time.I wish someone had illustrated this point... don't buy it unless you want it for Data DVD's (backups)."]}
