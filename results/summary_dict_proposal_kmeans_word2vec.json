      "Not bad compared to what I have heard for some people.1)The burner is sleek, stable, and nicely built.2)It gives you step by step instructions on how to set it up, which is especially helpful if you are not computer savvy.3)If you open the NeroSmart Start, it's a user-friendly interface that helps you fine exactly what you want to do.HOWEVER there are a few things I dislike about the DVD burner, nothing major however.1)The tray seemed a tad wobbly.2)The software is a trial, it is really nice software but it's only a trail version and It costs $60 to get the full program, kind of upsetting...So far I think this is a great investment and I am very happy with it.",
