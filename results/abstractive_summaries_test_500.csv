base in the speakers these would be great speakers for the casual music enthusiast but unfortunately they wouldn't be spending 250 on speakers"", 'i bought these speakers a few weeks ago and like them more and more every day the first thing i noticed when i hooked them up was that they are very loud after that initial reaction i felt as if there was a lack of good mid range shrill highs and overly

the speakers away from you like they suggest in', 'i have just bought these speakers i was looking for something to use in my flat for my ipod and wanted something loud and good quality i could not recomend this system more highly the sound is perfect and the bass is almost too much much cheaper than the bose ipod dock at only 200 rather than 250 yet it allows 2 sources and gives much better

impressed"", 'installing this speaker system was a cinch open the shipping box connect the satellite speakers to the computer and the sub woofer and you are ready to go the quality of sound from the satellites is not quite as rich as i would have liked but the sub woofer is great very deep bass that when its level is set properly compensates decently for the not so strong mid level presence in the satellites additionally the controls on the right satellite speaker are very handy so for the price i find this speaker system to be a very good deal', 'these speakers work fine for my computer the description said they were 64 watts i believe that must be peak to peak because they are only 32 watts rms but they still do the job quite nicely the bass speaker is awesome for the price i would

works well and is a perfect size and design for my small cottage however it is quite difficult to see the control labels i have to memorize what the various buttons do and then hope i hit the right one', ""my husband is an audiophile and laughed at me when i said i wanted this cd radio unlike him i don't really care that much about sound quality not that it doesn't matter to me at all it's just that he has the big nice sound system already so i was happy to get something that would look nice in the living room and could play in the background while i was reading i don't need or even like to play music very loud so something small and pleasantly retro like this was just what i wanted we don't all"", ""the cabinet looks great and fits well in the limited space we had available for it the sound is average which is to be expected <OOV> a standard radio the tuner is below average and hard to pickup stations we finally found the station the wife listens to during the day and we don't move it i have not tried the cd player yet but i feel safe to assume that it works fine"", ""i received this radio and it's just wonderful the sound is great and i just love the old time style well worth the money"", ""the cd player in the crosley <OOV> <OOV> radio with cd player is a good solid transport the playback quality is good considering the small speakers but the 1 8 stereo jack output on the front works great for routing the output to powered pc speakers or headphones and with that setup it sounds much better two minor issues the radio tuner dial is not centered in the window so the vertical <OOV> does not line up with the frequencies on the dial and the fm antenna wire could stand to be be another foot longer in short it's worth"", ""this radio has proven to be a conversation piece in our dining room as it does look rather cool and elegant and when you play older recordings say some bing <OOV> on <OOV> or <OOV> holiday on <OOV> it does a fine job and seems to match the period it's trying to represent when you play a newer recording say the new michael <OOV> cd however it falls majorly short and flat this has probably the worst sounding stereo sound i've ever come across on a unit like this those who like to listen to newer music should look elsewhere"", ""though i have no regrets and would purchase this radio again but only because there is no other maker of vintage style radios there are definitely a few things about this piece that really irritate me mainly dealing with the lack of authenticity one strange issue is that when you're listening to it you'll immediately be able to sense that the sound isn't even emitting from the front speaker grill as it is non functional the speakers are on the sides why install ugly side speakers when there is already a place for them on the front what disappointed me""]"

very own home photography pc mac studio does that qualify dear rolls people i think so anyway the sound and output is so compelling and incredible that i couldn't wait to publish this <OOV> like the other very nice review above this one ie the 1st one by the gentleman from"", ""i just needed a headphone amp that had rca inputs this fits the bill and is also a distribution amp that supports up to 4 other headphones which is neat sound as good as any amp that can be found for this price it's better in my opinion than any of the fiio amps"", 'you will not be let down by this headphone amp it has both 1 4 instrument and smaller headphone jacks on each channel the sound is excellent and it has no effect on your normal mix', 'i purchased this for my father so he could plug his headphones into it and control the volume on his new samsung smart tv this control has been great for him simple to use and great quality it has made my father who has severe hearing loss happy he can amplify his classic movies so he can enjoy them thanks']"

worth while reasonably priced purchase go for it"", ""i agree with other reviewers here that the product works as expected but does leaves a few air bubbles also it does not cover the entire screen there's a small gap at edge of screen the packaging explains this is intentional for easy removal it was also a bit awkward to apply to the screen i ended up ruining the first one and got it right with the 2nd one i'm just glad it comes with three of them"", 'i recently bought this item to install on my garmin 780 the installation was simple and if needed sf planet has detailed instructions on
