There is clearly an unpleasant, upper-mid harshness that makes them fatiguing to me for vocals, especially females, and for brassy instrumentals like jazz or Earth Wind and Fire.  I don't see complete specs (THD or +/- dB on frequency response) but I would say there must be a response peak, some harmonic distortion, or a resonance in the ear cups.  On the plus side, the bass does go much lower than the open air Sennheisers (as expected).  And, the bass is tight - not sloppy.  Kick drums sound really good.  Overall they don't seem intentionally colored, but I wouldn't call it perfectly &#34;flat&#34; if there is a response peak.I've probably listened at least 10 hours now at a good volume and left them playing another 20.  The harshness is not mellowing out.  As such, I probably won't use them for critical listening direct from vinyl or CD.  But, I did manage to tame it with a -3db notch at 4KHz (basic iTunes custom EQ).  With that, I can listen to an entire album at higher volumes than I should.  At safe levels, I think the pressure of the ear pads would make me take them off before the sound quality.  That's the other negative.  They are both heavier and tighter on the head than my Sennheisers or my Bose QC15s.Bottom line, I will actually use them.

The fewer full orchestral pieces I listen to also sound very good, but I use solo and sonata compositions as my benchmark. And btw, jazz (Wes Montgomery, Sarah Vaughn, Art Pepper, Bill Evans, etc.) is fine, but unfortunately, many of the actual recordings (often CDs remastered from the 50's tapes) don't seem to be as good - be aware that these headphones will highlight that (so be prepared to start fiddling with those above mentioned doodads and you'll improve the quality considerably ...)These headphones also have a low impedance (requiring much less power to drive the speakers), so you'll need to turn your system's master volume setting down or else you'll need tweezers to adjust the player volume controls.In summary, I'd consider these headphones to be an unqualified success (and according to the research/reviews I've read, have been made by Sony and used by professional sound engineers for decades ...)And under $100 (!)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very fine headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

This makes it easier to be able to enjoy the sound of a full-sized set of cans when on the go, as they are easily stored in a backpack or carry bag, taking up much less space than you would think. The wire is a coiled phone style cable which extends long enough to be comfortable at a mixing desk, but takes up the extra slack when used on a plane or train.And they are comfortable.

I'm a klutz--a real \"bull in a china shop\", constantly breaking things, losing things, stepping on things . . . etc . . . who also happens to live with three other equal klutzes. It was with no small amount of fear and trepidation that I took these supposedly fragile objects out of the box. No worries there! Yes, they are sensitive electronics, and need to be treated as such, but if I've dropped these things once, I've dropped them a thousand times; they still sound brand new and show no signs of damage.The sound on these is great, too. I can't say that it's the most natural you'll ever hear-- the bass and treble are ever-so-slightly boosted --but the effect is never less than satisfying. I listen to everything from classic rock to jazz to heavy metal, with  no small amount of classical thrown in to boot, and literally *everything* sounds at least good. Generally speaking, louder music sounds best-- softer pieces can seem a bit overdriven and/or smothered at times -- but I can gladly listen to anything on these headphones with great pleasure. To give full disclosure, my listening equipment is admittedly not that great: most of my listeing is done on my PC and my iPod, although we have a nice vintage audio setup from the 70's that I occasionally am able to use.Now for the bad news:These phones are kinda heavy. Not overbearing, and not heavy enough to make you feel like your spinal column is being smashed in, but moderately weighty. My neck took a little while to adjust-- I'd guess I took about 5 hours of listening to get used to the extra weight. For that matter, they're loose-fitting. Admittedly, these are studio monitors, and not earbuds, but even taking a walk up and down a set of stairs in these can leave you frantically grabbing to avoid dropping them on the floor. And this is from a guy with a decent-sized head! (I wear *about* a men's 8 and a half.)What's worst, though, are the earpads. They're moderately comfortable for short-term listening, but become uncomfortably hot and sticky after more than an hour or so; they're alo prone to fall apart. I'm already on my second set-- and have been for several months now! Also, the replacement earpads are hard to fit on, but that's another review for another product.Overall, I'd recommend them, but I'd also recommend looking at reviews of other headphones before taking the plunge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tough, versatile headphones with great sound and one big flaw", "unixReviewTime": 1312416000, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2011"}

It's not a true strain relief type grommet, and there is a small gap between the cable jacket and the grommet's inside diameter.

The new 2014 version sounds close to my excellent Japanese originals that I used for monitoring/mixing/mastering in my recording studio. Evaluated using original lossless digital masters from my recording studio as the source, and measured against my studio reference AKG Austrian made K701s, I find the new V6 are not as well balanced across the audio spectrum as the K701 headphones. The 2014 V6 has a noticeable boost in the low bass - educated guess, about +4dB or +5dB centered broadly around 70Hz - making them a bit less suitable for studio work (monitoring/mixing/mastering) than the K701s, and about +2dB or +3dB higher in the low bass than my vintage MDR-V6 headphones were when new. The 2014 V6 has excellent mid and high range reproduction, has very good image placement/sound stage, and no audible distortion, but does not  reproduce the low end of my master recordings quite as faithfully due to the low bass boost.The fit of the new V6 for me is snug without being tight or uncomfortable. Leakage is minimal, if at all, at anything less than levels that will damage hearing; and the isolation from external sounds is very good. Fitment is good, and the stitching on the leather headband is well done. But physically they seem just a tad \"different\" somehow. The originals have the feel of solid construction. Although the new ones look to be put together well, they just don't give that same sense of being as solid and durable.Earpads look like the pleather that's been problematic in the past for flaking. Another minor gripe - the cable of the new headphones was so tightly packed into the box that the coils are deformed in several places - but I was able to get the cable back in shape.So I've knocked off one star because of my subjective feeling about the physical qualities, and being a bit less suitable for studio monitoring/mixing/mastering than the AKG K701s. I'd have to determine exactly where and how much low bass needs to be EQ'd down to use these as highly accurate reference cans. That shouldn't be with headphones billed as \"studio monitors\", and it's a departure from the signature of the original \"Made in Japan\" V6 headphones, which, when new, were essentially flat over the majority of the audio spectrum (+/- 3dB between 25Hz and 10kHz), as true studio monitor headphones should be.This 2014 version of the V6 is still very good for home listening enjoyment (they also sound darn good with my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone), but some may want to turn the bass control down a bit (about 3dB or so) on the sound source. Consider looking elsewhere if you need a tool to do critical, highly accurate analytic studio monitoring/mixing/mastering.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "New 2014 version v.

My old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when I played full volume on the low end of the B string, and I thought I was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board, but after plugging in the Sonys, I discovered it was actually the headphones. The Sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bass.My only complaint is it takes about 75% volume on an iPod to get a reasonable listening volume, compared to about 55% on my old headphones.

And the jack is massive.  It may very well be designed for durability, but these headphones are not portable in any sense.2.  The headband just is not well designed.  It is made of very wide metal, with a vinyl padded cover.  The headband bows out tremendously -- I mean like 2-3 inches wider than your head on either side, unless you play offensive line in the NFL.  This not only looks awkward; it feels awkward.  Essentially the headband makes contact only at the very center of the top of your head.  This might not be a huge deal, but the headphones are quite heavy (compared to, say, any Bose headphones), and so you feel the whole weight of the phones on the top of your head.3. The earpads feel pretty nice.  But when I switched back and forth between 2 Bose around-ear headphones and these, these ones were much more cramped around your ear.  So not terrible, but not all that roomy.4. The sound struck me as very bright.  The most treble I have ever heard from any headphone or full-size speaker.  On certain songs, this is a plus, but for most, it is a bit irritating.  [I listen to a wide variety of 60s-90s rock mostly -- from REM to Snoop Dogg to Bob Dylan to the Clash to Soundgarden to Stevie Ray Vaughn].  In head-to-head comparisons with other high-end headphones, I judged these to be very light in bass.  It's hard to say if they are deficient or the others are exaggerating the bass (I am not a wannabe audiophile), but to me, these headphones lack fullness.  On the plus side, I can hear cymbals and snare much more clearly than with most headphones.  But the botom line is that I need to set my equalizer to reduce treble and/or increase bass to enjoy my music.  And I am someone who rarely touches the tone settings on a stereo (preferring a neutral sound) and am particularly unlikely to feel the need to increase bass.5. They are not very loud.  Only a bit quieter than the Boses, but if you are using an Ipod, they really aren't quite loud enough in my opinion.  The Monster Beats headphones are much, much louder, if that is a concern for you.6. While they do not actively cancel noise, I found them to be quite good at isolation.  Ambient sound was significantly reduced, arguably more so than with the Boses.Overall, too big and heavy and uncomfortable.

These babies are supremely comfortable (I had to remind myself I was wearing them after hours of listening) and sound *beautiful* with a crisp, clear response in all frequency ranges.  Now, my major gripe with most other closed circum-aural headsets is that they often opt to effectively destroy the original recording by beefing up the lower registers to unnecessarily high levels.  These guys, on the other hand, offer the most accurate sound reproduction I've heard in a pair of headphones under $250. Seriously. I went back and listened to all my favorite music with these bad boys and discovered an entirely new world of subtlety and grace in each track; I can finally hear what the composers and artists intended us to hear when they wrote and performed their music.  If you listen to classical, jazz, techno, or any other genre that tends to be particularly complex, the V6 will elucidate every last intricacy that other headphones leave obscured with their comparatively muddy sound quality.With respect to technology and electronics, I rarely have anything but complaints. I could list about a million and a half inanities common to products like cellphones and computer software, and when it comes to picture and sound quality, nothing is ever good enough - but these things have truly impressed me, as well as my musician compatriots.

In short, these headphones provide high sound quality and reasonably good sound isolation making them a good headphone for travel and moderately noisy environments.  However, if you are more interested in sound quality than in blocking outside noise, I recommend the Grado SR60i instead.I bought these hoping to be able to relax to my music while on a two week family road trip.  My usual headphones (Grado SR60) provide wonderful sound, but zero sound isolation making them terrible for listening in the car or other noisy environments due to sound leaking in and out.  So I was hoping these MDR-V6 headphones would provide enough isolation to block out the usual family/radio noise, while still providing excellent sound quality and being comfortable enough to wear for very long listening sessions.I found that, while these headphones don't have enough isolation to completely block out the sound of voices, they do muffle the voices enough to make them easy to ignore and difficult to understand.  Still if someone is being very loud they will still be a distraction with these headphones.I found the V6 to also be quite comfortable over a long period of time.  The ear pads fit around my ears completely, but just barely.  If I had slightly bigger ears, I suspect that these would offer a far less comfortable experience.  At first the head band seemed uncomfortable, but after adjusting it I haven't noticed any discomfort.I have found the sound quality to be very good.  The highs are very crisp and the lows sufficiently punchy for my taste.  My first impression listening to these was that they were a little too \"tinny\" sounding, but after listening for a while I came to really like the sound.  The sound is overall very smooth and calming and offers a lot of detail.That said, these are nothing like my Grados as far a sound quality is concerned.  The Grado SR60 headphones offer a far better listening experience and at a similar price point.  So if you're purely buying headstones for sound quality and will be listening in a relatively quiet environment, then I recommend Grados instead of these.  But if you need good quality headphone for a moderately noisy environment, then the Sony MDR-V6 is a good option.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for travel", "unixReviewTime": 1249430400, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2009"}

Since i had been using the Skull Crushers for so long, i Naturally looked for a pair that could at least do some relatively good bass. I bought these on account that they were on sale at the time and that they had pretty good reviews.The packaging looks really fancy. Right out of the box, you get a Leather Bag, that honestly is WAY to small to carry these around in. You also get an adapter for the end so you can plug these into amps and what not. The adapter actually SCREWS on, and because of that it is WAY more handy than the others I've gotten with other purchases.Now to the Head Phones. A lot of people complain about the tight fit from this pair. I'm not sure about my head size, I think I have a smaller head than usual, because i have No clue what these reviews are talking about. I've already worn these for a while and haven't felt this discomfort that people are raving about. The cord on the pair is really long itself, and its Coiled. If you're using these in a studio like they're intended, then this is a great feature. I don't use these at my computer or anything. I use them just for general use on car trips, and sometimes in public or maybe around school. If you're like me, the looong coil is a bit inconvenient. If you plan on wearing these around your neck like a pair of Beats, and it will dive you crazy to have to tuck the coil into a pocket or something, then you may want to try something else. It doesn't bother me a whole lot.The sound quality is quite superb. With some EQ mixing from my Music App on my phone, they sound absolutely wonderful. The bass, like other reviews say, is a bit flat, but, again with some tweaking on an EQ, the bass is great. Everything else sounds awesome. Highs are high, Lows are low. No shaaarp piercing. Its really a very full, warm sound. They do a pretty good job of keeping everyday noise out. really loud noises you can still hear. No people talking, cars, nothing like that. They feel well built in your hands, unlike some of the very plasticy headphones you can buy on Amazon. Extending the size reveals METAL, not plastic, and the metal has sizes on it.I would recommend these to anyone willing to drop some cash on some good headphones.

If you replace the connector, remember that the wire in the cable is VERY HARD to strip of its enamel. If the problem is with the connector itself, disassemble the factory plug, desolder the wires, and use the existing stripped/tinned wire ends in the new connector. This will save you a ridiculous amount of effort.The stock ear pads also deteriorate eventually. I got the velour replacements, which aside from being much nicer on the ears, also seem like they'll last much longer.Functionality - These are very functional. They fold up nicely for throwing in a bag. Sound quality is very neutral. No artificial emphasis of any frequencies (I'm looking at you, skullcandy/beats!). The curly cord is a big plus for me. It's not so great if you're on an portable music player, since it's rather bulky, but in the studio it's definitely an asset.Comfort - Decent. Improved when I got the velour pad replacements. I stretched mine a bit (such that the ear pads don't want to push all the way together when off your head) so as to reduce the pressure exerted by the headband.Overall recommendations: If you're looking for something inexpensive with good (but neutral) sound quality that you can throw in a bag, I'd get these.

I thought THOSE were good, sadly the rubber headphone plug started breaking apart and I pretty much don't use those headphones at all anymore. However, even before I broke these MDR-V6's in they were already 10 times better than the earbuds.I was considering getting the HD-280's but I wanted a pair of headphones I could use with my iPod touch and that didn't need a seperate headphone amp.Construction Quality - These headphones SCREAM quality. I can easily see myself using these 5-10 years from now. The headphone plug is no flimsy toy, it is an actual metal plug that wouldn't break if you drove a car over it. The length of the cord is rarely annoying because it doesn't tangle, and won't tug if you move further away thanks to its coil-like shape, and instead acts as a gentle spring.Audio Quality - I'll break this down by musical genre. (Headphones have been used for over 30 hours now, so they are broken in)1. Metal: Guitars are aggressive, sharp as they should be. I've never noticed the drums before using these headphones in \"Bullet For My Valentine - Scream Aim Fire.\"2. Techno/Dance/Trance: Tight bass doesn't spill out, so the beat doesn't overwhelm other rhythmic elements like claps and hi-hats. Vocals are super-clear and smooth.3. Hip-Hop, Rap, R&B;: The mids were clearer than what I was used to, which isn't bad at all. Bass is still tight and about as loud as the vocals, which is just right.4. Classical: Possibly the genre that sounded the best. Violins in Vivaldi's Four Seasons are sharp, piercing (coming from someone who has played violin for over 5 years now). Bass is soft and mellow.5. Movie trailers: This one really caught me by surprise. Turn the volume up a little more than usual and you're basically in a movie theater! The Apple HD movie trailer for Iron Man is just plain awesome on these cans.In general, I would say the sound quality is easily comparable to an expensive home theater system like the 7.1 Onkyo system I use at home for movies.

As for headphones, I've tried Grado's midlevel phones, the SR125s, a pair of Sony MDR-V600s (which served me well until an ex-girlfriend stepped on them) and have, more recently, bought and returned several pairs that were disappointments.  The Sony MDR-V6s are so incredibly good that I would have agreed to pay twice as much for them.  They're better than the MDR-V600s, which I thought were good phones while they lasted.  I dare say I like them better than my Grados, too, mostly because I prefer the closed design and find the Sonys to be more comfortable.  As for the pairs that I've owned then returned, I had a pair of Sony MDR-V700s that my wife got me for Christmas.  These went back to Amazon because I read reviews that said they broke too easily.  I then got a pair of really upscale import headphones from Bavaria, the Ultrasone HFI-550s.  These were great at spatializing the music, but I found that the bass response left a lot to be desired.  Sure I could have paid $250 for Ultrasone's deluxe pair, the HFI-650DVDs (a/k/a HFI-700s), but I'm really glad I found the Sony MDR-V6s instead.

I do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns. I have bought and used these:Sony MDR-CD230Sony MDR-V6Sony MDR-XD200My ears are not real fussy on quality, nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts, usually after 10-20 minutes of listening. My hatsize if about 7.25,my ears are pretty normal in size, I am middle aged. All three of these headphones I own are the best I have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past 2 years. Headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side, and the ear spaces, or cups, are oriented accordingly, to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe. The sideways pressure (how hard they clamp onto your head) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt. I wear wireframe glasses, and my use for headphones is background music while I program.$30 The CD230 is no longer available, that I could find (Fall 2006), and I've used them for 5 years. They hurt my ears after 3-4 hours of continual use, but are good before that. They have cloth covered ear cushions, and relatively deep ear lobe spaces. This feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not. If you can find these, and like cloth covered headphones, you won't be unhappy. The sideways pressure is light for me.$64 The V6 stands out for 2 things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises. Listening to classical music, not real loud, a co-worker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well. (Women's voices too). Overheard conversations are not overheard.I have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after 1-2 hours. The sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two, but not excessive. They are well cushioned, with soft fake thin leather-like vinyl which I did not find causes sweating at all. But there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit, and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably I am sure. If I did not have my eyeglasses on, then these are very comfortable.$26 The XD200 is a little lighter than the V6, it does not block out outside noises as well, which can be a benefit in the office because I can hear co-workers calling my name. The sideways pressure is light, the cushion is the same thickneess as the V6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe, so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones I've owned or tried. The cushions are covered in the thin leather-like vinyl like the V6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic, it feels dry, not clammy. To my unprofessional ears the sound is great. If you wear eyeglasses, don't want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch, then I think you will be happiest with the Sony MDR-XD200 headphones.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "very good sound and noise blocking, not the best for eyeglasses", "unixReviewTime": 1168560000, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2007"}

All my $20 cans were falling apart, so I looked for some accurate phones under $100 and landed on these - yes, easily competitive with anything up to $100. I've been comparing them to my previous best headphones, the Behringer HPS3000 (very ugly but incredible for $20). While I'm sure I'll discover more differences over time, the two three things I noticed immediately were:1. Build: You can see why these have a reputation for lasting decades. The plastic feels good, the folding mechanism clearly won't be getting worn out anytime soon. I've discovered that headphones with the wire inside the connection to the earpiece often break right there, the external wiring that some people find annoying is done for a reason. Also, they seem extremely comfortable, even though I have a fairly big head.2. Vocals: Dead giveaway. Voices are incredibly complex, and you can hear these phones breath life into your singer. I'm usually not a big fan of vocal music (I'm an instrumental jazz&classical; kind of guy), but I even enjoyed some blues, cause I could hear so much character in the voice.3. Drums: These headphones are intended to be relatively \"flat\" which means they don't try to enhance any frequencies - but they also don't significantly drop anything. The drums actually felt much punchier than the slightly bass-heavier Behringers.I highly recommend them (as well as the Behringers, if you're on a very small budget and don't care if you look like Mickey Mouse).BW", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "All I hoped for.", "unixReviewTime": 1323475200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2011"}

If you can find a pair that sounds better, that pair will be $500, and it won't blow these Sony's out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details.Comfort is good.  The foam goes fully around your ear(circumaural) and they are a closed can design so they &#34;block out&#34; outside sounds.  They aren't &#34;noise isolating&#34; or &#34;noise reducing&#34;, but they block enough to put you in your own audio space.  If you listen with these, you won't hear the phone ringing in the other room.  If you have sweaty ear syndrome or don't like headphones that are closed, these might not be up your alley.  That is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones.  I personally really like the closed, circumaural design.  The band and the ear pressure are exactly right.  In ten years, after you've worn through the ear pads, replacements will still be readily available online.Overall, these are the industry standard for a reason.  Time tested, excellent quality, unbeatable value.

Until recently a busy career and family life has pushed music much lower on my priority list in terms of spending my time and limited funds. I have a bit more time now but not a lot more money so I spent a lot of time reading reviews and agonizing over prices before ordering these.Overall, I'm quite pleased. I haven't used them with audiophile equipment or media yet but, used with my PC and my very good smartphone with (yes, compressed - at 320kbps) MP3 files, I'm recalling the quality and clarity of sound I remember enjoying in my youth. I would judge that the response of these headphones if quite flat - not colored at any part of the audio spectrum. I particularly like that they reproduce bass with great fidelity. Some tunes have &#34;tigh&#34; bass and others &#34;boomy&#34; bass and either one is reproduced nicely. I look forward to trying them with my home stereo system. The danger is that I'll probably like that so much that I will be tempted to upgrade my receiver.I find these headphones fairly comfortable and not too heavy or bulky. I'm undecided about the coiled cord as that makes the overall cord heavier (but conveniently longer when needed) and I'm worried about strain where the cord meets the left earpiece and at the jack end of the cord. I usually try to find a way to support the middle, coiled part of the cord to reduce strain on the ends.They block out just the right amount of ambient noise - if my wife wants to get my attention, she can, but most external noise is reduced sufficiently to enjoy music in most normal environments.If these last me 4 - 5 years, I will be a happy camper. I'm enjoying my extensive MP3 collection much more (and, therefore, much more often) than I have in the past.

One test I've used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments, especially the sound of a piano. If a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano they're usually a good bet. Being a acoustic string guy I also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar, mandolin and violin. If they are accurate on those simple tests then I would grab them. This set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything I listen for with exceptional precision. I paid a lot more than a $100.00 for my Sennheiser' but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of time.I would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound.

Little did I know that Sony still makes the same model! That's right, some 18 years later, I now own my own pair of the exact same headphones. If the fact that Sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesn't say enough about these, then nothing I say would do much justice, but I'll try anyway.I have a 24\" head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly, I bought them anyway. Once I got them I did notice they are a bit tight, but since I have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on, this is not a concern to me. Plus, in time I expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use. The padding on the ears are very nice, but I can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying, but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears.Once on, I can't think of any other headphones I've tried that sound as good. For my desktop speakers, I use aKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)that sounds amazing when playing songs through iTunes or Pandora, so I needed something better than the Apple earphones I was using when I didn't want to blast out my roommates. The MDR-V6 headphones do just that. Of course they don't have the same punch as a floored subwoofer, but surprisingly, the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable.Until I bought these, I wasn't even really using the iTunes equalizer.

They both are undeniable stars in the headphones scene.The difference between the V6 and MDR7506 is very small, but there is a difference, both in sound (maybe my V6s just need to break in, but I generally don't believe in the break in process for speakers)The MDR7506 from the very beginning were absolutely amazing. Very natural sounding, great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music. I loved listening to some of the Eagle's stuff on them, they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums. They are loose fitting on the ears somewhat, keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable. The cable is very good rubber, limber and returns to it's shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched out.The V6s have an almost equally amazing sound, more bass response than the MDR7506. Seems that they lack (just very so slightly) the clarity of the MDR7506. Earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the 7506s. The cable on these is no doubt quality, and will last years under normal circumstances, but the 'nice' factor is not the same feel. The actual plug is just like that on the 7506, same screw on 1/4\" adapter, but the shell is nickel finished instead of black, and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated. Nickel is actually preferable, against popular belief, because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in it's life will have nickel plated contacts, and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching. Not really a problem in a clean, dry studio, but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mind.In the end, if you're looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind, go with the 7506, if you're doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod, the V6s are where it's at.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "VERY good headphones.

Darn :DI want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head, yet are firm enough to not fall off. Sound quality is extremely important to me, not just blasting bass or highs or anything. These have excellent fidelity. You can hear the highs, the lows, and the mids very clearly on this set, and one is not overpowered by the others. One thing I have noticed about lower-end headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music (or games, or movies) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously. These headphones do not have that problem. After reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years, I look forward to a long relationship with these.I listen to a wide variety of music, and everything from Linkin Park to Mozart sounds great on these headphones, as well as a wide variety of PC games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival, to FPS games with explosions and gunshots. I have noticed with these phones, I feel like I have my 5.1 system on, and have to take them off to ensure I am not being obnoxious to my neighbors, only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that I am hearing. The same thing happened with our digital piano, I thought I was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them, but that was not the case. Anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations, or they do not know what sound quality is.Update 2/15/2013So, I wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction. I have put them on when I sat down at my computer, only to realize an hour later I was still wearing them, and not listening to any music.

That being said, here are my comments:1. After about 8 hours of 'burn-in', sonic quality is quite good. Definitely improving with time.2. The connecting wire at the left channel came 'pinched' in the sliding ear piece. The pinch damaged the wire--squished it--but so far so good. Still, it should not have come out of the package this way; that's a Sony quality control issue.3. Sony's packaging was excellent from the standpoint of product protection but I considered it to be overkill and wasteful of mostly disposable material.4.

Perhaps it's the Pink Floyd that followed. Maybe it's just that it's Friday night, and after the realization that my employer views my fellow employees and I as easily replaceable as Band-aids--and equally detestable as used Band-aids--I'm just relishing my own time and the simple satisfaction of cruising through my play-lists randomly to test out these new headphones and remember a time when I was a stupid kid and the whole wide world laid before my feet, thinking I could wedge myself and my mind into any professional crevice that suited me. Whatever it is, I'm in a sort of sublime revelry right now. Not sublime in any sense of unknowing, band-name reference that just calls out vocabulary I hope others will automatically connect to.No. This type of sublime is like standing on the highest point in Hell's Canyon and being instantly dwarfed, feeling the raw power of a place that is so overwhelming in size and power that I feel my place in this universe for what it is. Tiny and irrelevant to the overall flow of time and space. It's like the realization that after dying, my only purpose would have been to feed worms, if we hadn't decided to load our dead with preservation chemicals that make us unpalatable to any living thing, but still knowing that what I leave behind in family and works will be just enough to live on--that sort of hope mixed with despair. Honestly it feels good.These friggin cans halve the background noise when put on, even with no music. Once the music starts, I can't even hear the \"Teen Mom\" my wife is watching, or the video game my son is playing. I can't hear the kids next door shouting and gasping at a dumb frat boy breaking a beer bottle over his head. The screaming drunk girl in the apartment across the way is gone. By the time Blind Melon starts, and I've poured my third beer, this spot on the couch feels every bit as eye-opening as any teenage first-time experience.I know there's better over-ears available. I know that there's better output for audio. However, at my income level, this is the most magical thing I've purchased in the last year. This is almost better than the native Idaho cutthroat I caught on a fly I tied myself, standing waist deep in a river without those waders I can't afford, fighting current that wants to wash me into the rapids only a few feet away, where the North Fork of the Clearwater drops suddenly into a raging narrow channel, reaching into the icy water to hold a final remaining natural vitality for a brief moment before setting it loose again, wading back to the purple granite beach to sit in the sun and smell the watery pine shores of a single remaining wild river.This audio experience, as modest as it may be in monetary terms, has filled in a hole that is usually spent gazing into the void and contemplating the nothingness canonical authors can only address by describing its boundaries.If you want nuts and bolts, the coiled cord is thick and firm--with a heft that says the money I saved to buy this will last a while. The pressure on the ears is as comforting as falling asleep against the breasts of a new lover. The sound quality is the best I've ever experienced--so much better than a worn out Toyota's stock speakers or a second-hand Macintosh or a cheap Phillips stereo system dressed in clear-coated maple to make it seem like a luxury. I'm hearing qualities, details, and performances in this music that I didn't even know existed. I could literally sleep in these headphones, and just might now that our thrift store couch is empty of family and friends, waiting with worn cushions and ratty blankets for someone to curl up and float through a flashback of carefree days when drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes could possibly kill me, not that I'd live long enough to ever know. Now, mostly sober, with aching feet and knees, I'm the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin.Thanks, Sony.

Last night, one of the ear pads slipped off.  My son has a pair of headphones with a similar design, so he told me to just unclip the center of that earpiece and slip it back on.Turns out that the center of the earpiece on my headphones can only be removed by unscrewing four screws.  Once the piece is removed and the ear pad is slipped back on, the screws are covered up!  We reattached the ear pad with some shipping tape at one edge (to hopefully keep it from slipping off again), and screwed the screws back in while it was folded back away from the screws.  Once that effort was completed, we had to slip the flimsy edge of the ear pad back into a very narrow slot and stretch it all the way around the fixed plastic part of the earpiece.  That step was a nightmare!Now these aren't the most expensive headphones out there, but they aren't bargain basement priced either.  The edge of the ear pad that slips over the ear piece is extremely flimsy, so I'm sure the other ear pad will slip off very soon.  And the way that the ear pad attaches to the earpiece was designed by an idiot!The sound quality of these headphones is great, and the comfort is excellent as well.

He said he listened to acoustic music and rock music and was interested in some headphones that would block out noise as he is a frequent traveler.  Upon replying to him I realized that I never wrote a proper review of these excellent headphones.  Rather than tailoring a review for Amazon I just copied the email I wrote:The Sony MDR-V6 was the fist \"real\" headphone I ever got. They have been largely unchanged for years. I actually got my pair for my 14th or 15th birthday.  I used them all throughout high school and used them daily in college. They served as my walking to class headphones/earmuffs which helped make it through some nasty winters in Bowling Green, Ohio. A day did not go by that I did not use them, slam them in backpacks, drop them, sit on them, etc. I beat the begeezus out of them and I'm surprised they still work. I would have not thought poorly of them if they crapped out years ago.  At present, some 15 years later, my little brother is using them and reports no issues. These headphones are well worth the current street price.  Even at the MSRP I wouldn't consider them a bad deal.  The only thing that might ever need to be replaced are the ear pads, which are constructed of faux leather and tend to flake off after about a decade. But those are cheap and widely available.  And honestly, how often does one talk in terms of decades when referring to current production consumer electronics?These headphones aren't really noise canceling per se. They are just big closed headphones that cover your whole ear and that serves to block out the noise. I would say this is marginally helpful in an airplane. You can block out some of the sounds but you know you are on a plane. If your goal is truly to block out airplane noise, buying active noise canceling headphones are the only way to achieve that. The asking price on such headphones are quite a bit more.  The Sony MDR-V6 works to block out some noise, but don't expect miracles in regards to how much sound is blocked out.Ok so they're durable and would make a good travel buddy.  So how do they sound!?!?On the sound the MDR-V6's are overall good. They are very detailed and you will be able to listen deep into recordings and hear things you've never heard before. This is kind of a surreal experience the first time around. I have fond memories of my first weeks owning these headphones because such marked the first time I was ever truly wowed by a sound system because of sound quality and not just because it was loud. I suspect you might want to rip some CD's at lossless quality vs using the typical lossy/mp3 stuff. You'll find that these headphones are not accommodating of poor recordings or low quality digital conversions. If something in the recording is bullhonky, they'll tell you. My chief criticism is that the resolution comes a bit at the expense of neutrality; perhaps too much so.  The headphones possess a live sound. If you could picture an equalizer the lower bass and the treble are bumped up a bit. if your listening preferences tend towards acoustic guitar and rock, this bumped treble feature makes listening fun.  As an example, take an acoustic guitar. These headphones are a trip because you can clearly hear that leading edge of stings being plucked. Think of the intro to the track \"Stay (Wasting Time)\" by DMB. You'll absolutely love acoustic guitars on these. Where this enhanced treble thing bugs me is if the vocals are recorded crappy and/or there is too much sibilance (think of too much sibilance as an over exaggerated hissing/whistling \"S\" sound then someone says \"little suzy saucer sitting on a thistle\"). This is not too huge of a deal but just something to be aware of.... on a long enough timeline it drives me bonkers, but this is more of a personal preference thing.What is also very nice about these is that you do not need an amplifier. Many headphones require an amplifier to sound right. These do not. They will work fine right out of your portable media player or phone.Hopefully these will serve as a good entry into the headphone world. There are many other options to be had and you can get some particularly rewarding sounds out of open headphones (those not designed for travel and that do not block out ambient noise) combined with a dedicated amplifier and a proper digital setup.... dare I say even a vinyl based setup.

Sure they aren't as quite crisp as the Beyers I own, or maybe not quite as musical as the Senns or warm as the Grados, but they are the cans I use more than all of the others combined. They sit on my desk folded up neatly, just always ready. My toddler can throw them at the wall and I know they will be totally fine. I can throw them into a backpack and know they will be fine. Even if they did somehow wind up damaged, I'm only out one kite flyer.Buy these headphones, you will not regret it. I assure you of this.

The remaining 10% it's usually a mix of more obscure Beyers, or more often some nice AKGs.

I have a big head, not a huge head, but, a bigger head than some other guys. Sony should've called these headphones the headlock series! Like another reviewer said, don't discount the tightness complaints. Don't get me wrong, these sounded great and after burn-in would probably be the best headphones I've ever owned. But, I don't think I will ever know because they hurt my head so bad after less than an hour of listening that I had to take them off!Also, I notice a lot of reviewers of headphones talk about sounds getting in. I listen to these at work, so I don't mind knowing when someone has approached my cubicle. I just don't want my songs leaking out to bother other co-workers. I bought a more comfortable pair of Sony headphones (mdr-xb500). They sound even better out of the box than the V6's to me. But, they don't look as good (actually they make you feel kinda of corny like you're in some cheesy B hip/hop movie from the 80s). But, where the V6's seem to excel at keeping the sound in just your ears, the mdr-xb500's seem to excel at just the opposite! I would call them more akin to speakers you wear on your head than headphones!I am still on a quest for headphones up to 100 bucks, with decent bass that are around the ear headphones (don't like ear buds). I also want them to be comfortable since I listen to music for sometime more than three quarters of my time at work with little to no sound leakage. I will take any suggestions on other headphones I should try.Let me sum up by saying that you cannot go wrong with these headphones if you have a small head or can take the grip!

If you use your headphones primarily for desk work, there shouldn't be any problems.-The pads were initially hurting my ears, so I was considering buying the Beyerdynamic pads to replace them.  After about two weeks, the pain disappeared and I've decided to stick with the original ones.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it.

I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some really nice headphones for a reasonable price.", "unixReviewTime": 1371945600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2013"}

I've had two V6s so far (both made in Thailand in 2012).PackagingThe headphones, the cable, and the pouch don't really fit in the box, and as a result they all show signs of stress out of the box. The pouch was folded twice to fit and got creased, the cable got small dents and the straight sections got crooked, the headband got asymmetrical, the earpads got also slightly squashed. Both units were new, purchased from different sellers, same story. The gold colored box and shiny red cloth make the false and pretentious statement that they accomodate a premium product, but it's really just money wasted on masquerade. A more spacious and simpler packaging is needed.SoundAfter three weeks (about 100 hours) it has finally burned in and the upper midrange harshness that was so apparent in the first two weeks is now gone. The bass is punchy and generally dominant at lower volume levels, the mids are always a bit recessed. From about 1/3 volume, the lower treble and upper midrange starts to come foreward and overpower and from 1/2 i can hear some distortion.I find its sound signature most suitable for electronic dance music, and least for symphonic orchestral music.Headstage / soundstage: Everything sounds to come from either inside my head or behind and lower than my head.Sensitivity and volumeIt's easy to drive, even by an iPod. On the Macbook Pro, 25-50% is plenty loud. On the iPod touch it's ideal: 50% is about a medium volume.IsolationSeals properly all around, but surroundings are hearable at low volume levels. To the outside, in a quiet room, there is very small leakage at 1/3 volume (driven by Macbook Pro).ComfortAfter a week of getting used to, it's only slightly tiring after a dozen-hour stint. Sometimes i barely feel they're on, which is ideal. The clamping force is optimal, it doesn't hurt my head and it won't fall off when i tilt my head forward (it's slowly sliding off when i look up).The cups aren't big enough though: the width is barely ok, but they're not tall enough and so the pads press my ear lobes against my head, which makes them sweat. Otherwise it doesn't make the rest of my ears sweat, but they itch sometimes due to the lack of ventilation. It's warm but not hot. These apply for January weather with low humidity and 21&#8451; inside; I still have to see what it's like with these on in humid summer 35&#8451;.Design and buildThe only metal parts of the whole framework are the inner part of the headband; and the smaller covers of the cups (with the writing and the label), which is misleading because it's only cosmetic: the inner side of that cover is still plastic.The steps of the headband don't hold strongly enough and so the band tends to gradually contract on my head over the course of hours, effectively pulling the cups upwards. This movement is not noticeable per se, but when i check i can feel it has moved out of setting and have to readjust.The articulating parts between the band and the cups make small plasticky clicking and knocking sounds for slight movements, sometimes even when i don't move my head; it's very annoying and distracting. Both V6s i owned did this (this could be similar to the creaking issue of the V700 and V55 i've read about). I needed to make the joints tighter with some stickers to make them shut up.The cable entry on the left cup (where the cable goes into the strain relief), also made noises when moved, as if they were sticking to and unsticking from each other. I had to disassemble the left cup, move and clean the cable and strain relief to eliminate the issue, which was only on the second unit.Cable and plugBoth the coiled cable and the straight plug are big, heavy and look durable.OverallFor the money, the V6 sounds good, and i really appreciate sturdy and utilitarian design in general.

I tried several, including what I thought would be just as good or better, the newer Sony MDR-V600. But they didn't sound as good.

The Sony MDR-V6 pair did the best job.  Based on that, I bought them.  Imagine my shock when I listened to them and realized that they gave me better sound than my actual speakers did!  Over the 20 years since then, the padding disintegrated, and in my last move, they got... um.  A bit crunched.  I was heartbroken, as I remember Sony replacing the V6 with a far lesser pair of V600 headphones.  They had (I thought) renamed the V6 and tripled the price.  Not so, apparently!  I found my current pair of V6s right here on Amazon for the exact price I'd paid for them (at cost, remember) back in 1987!! (9/20/13 Edit: I bought them for sixty dollars both times; I've seen them go 50% higher on Amazon, but as long as they are less than a hundred, they are still worth it.)If you have any desire to hear your music without distraction, if you want the headphones that professionals use, if you want to have sounds coming at you that you cannot even *hear* but more feel, then buy these headphones!The sound quality is unparalleled in its price range.

Those ten feet equal freedom of movement that couples with phenomenal sound.The phones even let you do that little thing you see professionals do in those shows, where they flip an earpiece over and hold it up to their ear without putting the band over their head!  Or, flip one *while* it's over your head to enable a friend to listen to what you're listening to!I have read some people saying that these phones are uncomfortable.

It's hard to point out a single pair as the best, they are all better suited for different purposes.- Firstly, what I personally expected of these headphones was their good balance. They are not perfectly balanced though. As others have already mentioned, these phones have some very irritating, strong and screechy lower high frequencies between 2khz and 3khz. This makes them very inappropriate for classical music and especially wind instruments. I was expecting this fault to be apparent, but sadly it turned out somewhat worse than my expectations. It can be fixed with an equalizer, but that can cause some of the detail to be lost.- Aside from that one fault with the highs, the V6s have a good balance between lows and mids. The lows extend really far, but do not interfere with the mids and have a nice detail and energy - probably the best trait of these 'phones. This makes them perfect for electronic music. Trance, drum and bass etc. it all sounds too good for this price.- The midrange freq. was what I needed most out of these. Along with the fact that they lack a big soundstage. I was hoping they would be suitable for translation purposes. And they are doing fine. I can hear all voices very clearly, well separated from other sounds/noise. It all sounds well with music too. Male voices would seem to sound a little better as females' voices tend to extend into the highs sometimes, and, as I said earlier, these 'phones are not the best for that.- Comfort-wise I'm very, very happy. I can wear them for several hours without feeling them on. However, the pleather earpads do make my ears sweat a lot in warm weather. This can be fixed with the beyerdynamic earpads.- Durability-wise, the V6s have an aluminum housing, which makes them very sturdy. I like the feeling of it, they are solid. The construction is excellent and there is no creaking as is the case with a lot of the alternatives. The only fault is again the earpads. Mine began tearing as soon as the second week after I got them.The Beyer ones seem durable though.- Isolation - they don't leak a lot of music, and isolate from the outside relatively well while not pressing hard on the ears. This was not the case with the Sennheiser hd-80 that I tried out before buying these, for example. Those were pressing too hard, and while isolating better than the V6, the area around my ears began hurting after around an hour or so.All in all these are a very good headphones considering their price.

Other people's comments helped me so I hope mine help you decided between the two. For the money, I would go with Sony MDR-V6. You can't go wrong, for the price point it's worth the money. Nothing to complain about, great sound, comfortable, light weight. The coil attached to the left ear cup can be heavy at times but this is the issue with all the coil cable headphones. When folded, it is pretty small and easy to transport. If you think you are bass inclined, just go with V6.Now for Shure440 - personally I like the sound of this headphone better. Caveat: I replaced mine with Shure880's earpads. I highly recommend getting the replacement if you are going to spend money buying 440. It makes a substantial difference, much more comfortable and sounds better in my opinion. Shure440 separates sound better and has better sound stage. It has a bright warm tone that I personally like. To my ear, it is more neutral than the V6 - meaning it doesn't really emphasize anything versus the V6 seems to have a slight emphasis on the bass. One more thing to complain about besides the stock earpads is the weight. It's solidly built but a little heavy - for a long period of listening you will definitely wish it is lighter like MDR-V6.Both are very good headphones - if you do enough research you will find that these 2 comes up a lot as good headphones for under $100 price point. Each have their own personality and sound signature. I wouldn't say they are similar at all.

In warm weather, the vinyl wrap around the ear pieces could cause some extra perspiration, so these are not a good choice for working out or really much of anything outdoors.They really do provide stellar sound if you want quality but do not want the hassle and expense of an additional headphone amp.  iPods and other portable devices drive these plenty loud.They are also closed-end in their design, which is nice if you are listening to music and don't want to disturb others around you.  You have to turn them up pretty loud for others to hear them while you have them on.I also am a big fan of the curled telephone-style cord that comes with these.  Am I the only one who tires of 10-12 foot long headphone cables getting in the way when all you want to do is listen to your iPod?  With these, if you need to stretch for some extra distance, you can, but they stay nice and tight, not taking up too much room if you don't need it.My main complaints with them are that the plastic wishbone-style clips used to connect the earpieces to the headband can be easily broken if the headphones are dropped.  This is not an individually replaceable part so far as I know.  The collapse-able design is convenient for storage, but they can tend to collapse when you don't want them to, which is kind of a pain.  And the screw-on 1/4 adapter plug that comes with it is easily lost, like they all can be, but since these use a screw-on design for the plug instead of a snap-on, which is more common, choosing an improper replacement adapter plug is easy to do.If you want stellar bass, are not too terribly sensitive to a bright sound, want reasonable comfort and high sound quality, the MDR-V6s are an excellent buy for you if you do not want to wander into the $200 and up market.  I prefer them to the Grado SR-60s or SR-80s.You just have to give them time to break in; much more important than on other sets of cans I have used.  But they are highly recommended.  At the price listed here on amazon, they are a steal.  You might have the wanderlust for Grados, Sennheisers, AKGs pricier offering, or even the Bose Triports.  But these are as good or better than nearly all of those, for a fraction of the price.

Wendel", "helpful": [139, 143], "reviewText": "NOTE: These headphones are in every way the same as the MDR-7506's, well-loved headphones for studio work.  Even the replacement part #'s are exactly the same.  So this review is for either one (I bought both).Anyone who has been listening to music on normal street headphones will be blown away by these.  The first thing you notice is how soft and comfortable they are to wear - the earcups surround your ears, leaving no pressure on the ears themselves.  Then, when the music starts, you notice:1) background noise is blocked out2) bass is full and punchy, not muddy, boomy, or distorted3) every detail shines through4) the music is LOUD for the given volume settingHere are my comments on these four aspects:1) background noise is blocked outBecause these headphones surround your ears and are \"closed back,\" they really do diminish outside noise.  It's nothing like the Bose active noise-cancelling headphones, though - these ones just turn down the volume on outside noise rather than pulling the plug on it.  This is on purpose - many headphone designers feel that active noise cancellation discolors the sound too much.2) bass is full and punchy, not muddy, boomy, or distortedThe drivers are big on these, and the CCAW coils let them draw power when they need it without getting muddy.  If you do hear distortion, it's probably that your player can't dish up enough power, so try switching to a good amp.  My portable CD players works fine though, and I hear ipods do too.3) every detail shines throughThese headphones are really detailed, meaning they reproduce high mids and trebles well.  You will probably hear things you've never heard before like breaths, guitar fretboard noises, and string instruments.  However, this makes you feel like you're right in the middle of everything, and it can get tiring after an hour or two.4) the music is LOUD for the given volume settingThe impedance on these is lower than most headphones, which means that for a given voltage these will draw more current and hence sound louder.  However, power is power, and your battery only has so much of it.  So these don't necessarily extend battery life, they just give you more options for how quickly to use it.For comparison, I also own the Sennheiser HD 201, 280Pro, and 595.  All are more soothing (less bright) while retaining the detail.  The 201's don't match the bass or noise dampening of the V6's.  The 280Pro's don't have quite the same bass (still great!), are much less comfortable, but block noise better and sound sweeter.  The 595's are superior to the V6's in every way (bass accuracy, sweetness, comfort) except that they intentionally don't block out noise at all and require a good amp to sound their best.  (Plus they cost almost twice as much as the V6's.)In summary, you'd be hard pressed to find a better price/performance/comfort balance than the V6's.  Try the HD 201's first for classical or instrumental music (they only cost $20, so trust me, try them!), but if you want noise dampening and/or punchy bass, don't hesitate to grab a pair of these.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1162425600, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2006"}

I added theSennheiser HD-555and Sony MDR-V6 to my collection of headphones.  I intended to keep both because I was going to use them differently.  I got the Sennheiser HD-555 mainly for movies and the MDR-V6 for music.  Unfortunately, I had to send one of them back.PROS:- High quality build- Folds compactly- Fairly comfortable- Out of this world frequency range- Nice bass- Love the coiled cord- Includes carry pouchCONS:- Highs were harsh for meFirst off, I burned in both sets of headphones for about 2 straight days.  I then spent about 4 hours comparing both headphones with a variety of sources.  My intention wasn't to eliminate one but just to compare them since they were both nice headphones.Right away I noticed that the bass response on the MDR-V6 was much better.  Listening to rap, techno, trance, and synthpop was much more fun on the MDR-V6 than on the HD-555.  After a couple of hours, I started to notice I was turning the volume down on the MDR-V6 because it was causing discomfort.  However, I realized that it wasn't the volume, but that the highs in some of the music I was listening to were just harsh.  Too harsh.  The MDR-V6 is more than likely reproducing the highs accurately, but the trade-off is that some music was just too fatiguing to listen to.  Red Hot Chili Peppers just killed me!  If I hadn't been comparing them to the HD-555 I may not have noticed it.  I think I am in the minority of users who have an intolerance to those higher frequencies.  I was disappointed to have to send them back.  By the way, my source material were Lame VBR encoded MP3's, some FLAC encoded music files, and DVD movies.On the flip side, I felt that the actual physical comfort of the headband and ear cups were quite reasonable.  The pressure was not nearly as intense as theSennheiser HD-280 Pro.  The coiled cord, compact folding, carry pouch, and durability were all things I found to be very positive.I am not saying that the Sony MDR-V6 will be harsh for everyone.  I believe I actually have a heightened sensitivity to higher frequencies for some reason so it might just be me.  But if you get them and feel your ear drums ache, you may be experiencing the same issue I did.  A vast majority of users who have purchased them seem to have great success with them.

About this reviewers references.. Been listening to music since 1983.. have had my share of ear accessories - aiwa, sony, koss, sennhieser, random studio recording headphones (no idea what they were) and would say these mdr-v6's are good, but not great.. Sound clarity is definitely it's strength.  Everyone is going to have a personal opinion and mine is that these cans can be listened to for hours.  I'm shocked to have read that folks thought these were too bassy.  I'm on the other side of the fence.  I think however I'm all for basslines woven in with highs..  I suggest if anyone wants to test these cans should try their test on various media to get more out of their experience with these headphones.  So far they really can tell a poor mp3 over a larger audio file on itunes.  These are going to be used for personal enjoyment not for a professional studio.  I may try these cans on my dj friends equipment, but really don't want to take them anywhere but home.. yet these are transportable.About the comfort= my ears are small.. they are about 2 inches in height and 1.5 in width and fit right into the ear cushions.  Perfect. I can't hear a thing outside nor inside my room.  They do get a little warm, but not an uncomfortable type of heat.. more like these things are growing on your head! Snug fit definitely.. still new.Durability= yes these are questions I would've liked to have known before purchasing headphones.  I was hoping that the two elbows that hold the cans themselves would be solid steel or metal.. to my dismay they are those plastic (break this and you got to buy a new one) elbows.  I wouldn't mind finding a good pair of headphones that had a metal elbow that would hold them.. that is usually where they break/or get the wire pulled.  Hey there is an idea for a headphone maker!! Headphones that last.. but would probably be less business for them.. (they'd have my money and my friends).  Yes so just like many headphones if you sit on these flush.. you will probably break that part of the headphone.. haven't tried it yet though and not wanting to.In the end I am quite pleased with these headphones..  I guess the only coupe de grace would be durability/bass.  I would still like to test these headphones on dj equipment and other formats.*Just picked up some problems on the selling point of these headphones given the impedance rating on these phones they should sound good on my itunes :(  was listening to Deadmau5 with the track STROBE and the highs start to crack and pop.. now I'm starting to get a better feel for these headphones.  They sound good for (rock) sound tested Van Halen 1984.  I guess for the price you get something good not amazing. Listening now.. and not getting that tingly feeling you get when you're *embraced* by the mids *touched* by the highs and *rocked* by the bass..I think these are good for an overall good experience.. nothing mind/body altering.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Avid Listener= Journeyman Audiophile", "unixReviewTime": 1303516800, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2011"}

High notes are notable without being screechy. Distortion even at high volumes or the highest and lowest pitches is nonexistent. The super long cord is also something one would love in a studio, though it can be a minor hindrance in daily use. Another very slight drawback is that nothing is easily replaceable, but the cord is very heavy duty, the headband sturdy but flexible, and the ear cups seem to hold up well.

However, these, I have to admit, are pretty nice!  So, here's my take on them so far:Pros:1.  Compact!  These are great for traveling, and fold up nicely to fit in the included carrying bag.  Much more convenient than my old headphones that didn't fold.2.  Quality construction.  I like how these are made.  They're pretty solid, nothing fancy, and look durable.  The only downside I noticed, which another reviewer I noticed pointed out, is that there's the exposed wires near each ear which could be damaged if you're not relatively careful.  I also like the long, coiled cord.  It expands for great length, but shrinks back up to help keep it out of the way when you don't need an insanely long cord.  The connector also looks to be very solid.3.  Great sound!  These took a little time to get used to, after using poor-quality cans for a long time.  I had earbuds and some cheapie circumaural headphones, and these are definintely much better at providing clear sound than any set I've had in the past.  They're good at blocking out most sounds.  And are great, even at louder volumes.  As far as bass is concerned, I have no problems recommending these to anyone who loves their bass.  Mine, even without the \"burn-in\" time, provide sweet bass response.  (And I love plenty of bass.)4.  Comfortable.  I have no problems wearing these for longer periods of time.  They're not tight, and have ample padding.Cons:1.  The exposed wire near each can.  It could be damaged fairly easily.  But if you're relatively careful, you should be fine.2.  Coiled cord.  I know not everyone will like the coiled cord.  So this could go either way.  If a coiled cord bothers you, maybe look for something with a straight cord.So, that's it!

Mostly used for mostly music playback and some PC gaming. These headphones fit the bill. At their price, how can you beat these?Sound, these have a great sound. Just so you know where I'm coming from...I've been married to my Bose Triport headphones that I bought years ago. I paid $150 for those. Compared to those, soundwise, they're about even, with the edge going to the sturdier Sony's. The sound is excellent at the bottom, mid's and highs. I found the sound level to be even accross the sound field. Very flat. But flat in a good way, as these can produce very good lows, mids and highs. Not any one particular range dominated, which is perfect.Construction is without a doubt, excellent. These things will take a beating. The cushions are comfortable. I have a huge head and I found these to be fine. Not tight or uncomfortable.The only ding against this fine headset is the cord, it's long, thick and heavy. Not very portable. I wish there was a way to mod the wiring to put something like what Bose uses on these, then these would be PERFECT. I believe a different version of this headset has a more portable wire. 3.5mm jack is not compatible with iPhone's bumper case. Carrying case is thick and cheap looking.Overall, if you're a headset aficionado, I think you will appreciate these. A fine headset to add to the collection. Pass on the Beats by Dre, save money and enjoy.**UPDATE**10/21/2013**The cord was really getting to me, so I cut it. Big mistake. I was hoping to just splice the wiring and make the wire shorter, and manageable. When I went to cut the cord and strip the ends, I found these very thin wires. I believe they were L channel, R channel and ground. Well, when I went to touch the ends together and test, I got no audio whatsoever. GREAT, just killed a perfectly good set of headphones.

The others aren't lying, these headphones are unbelievable.  I find them extremely comfortable, and don't think they feel heavy like others have said.

I've listened to Led Zeppelin for 20 years, and now I'm re-listening, hearing (and feeling) subtle sounds I never heard before.  They'll almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albums.Where they seem to fail is with fake music, such as rap, hip hop, or anything else created with synthesizers or computers.

After reading up on MDR-V6 (apparently a classic design, dating back to the 80's) I took the plunge.  Glad I did.Word of caution: As stated elsewhere, these are &#34;monitors&#34; and as such they will faithfully reproduce your music, without coloring or enhancement.  In this age of compressed digital music, that means you might have to accept that some of your (older?) MP3s do not sound nearly as good as you thought.  This is not the fault the MDR-V6 - it's just accurately rendering what was always there.  Only now you can hear it.The first thing I noticed switching from the XB500 to the V6 was the altered bass presence.  The 'XB' in XB500 means 'extended bass' (or 'enhanced' - I forget which), and the headphones are designed to give that 'boomier' bass experience.  The V6s don't boom, instead rendering the bass deeply and tightly.  Swapping between the two a few more times revealed the XB500's increased bass performance was the result of trading off 'muddy boominess' for detail and accuracy.  The good news is you can easily coax the V6 into duplicating that boominess by adjusting your equalizer's bass settings and overriding the V6's naturally flat response. In short, the V6 can emulate the XB500 far better than XB500 can do the opposite, and this would be the case with any other headphones that feature a bass-heavy signature.  As for the mid and upper frequencies - same as the bass.  Everything is there, clearly articulated and balanced.  If something doesn't sound good, the problem lies somewhere before the signal got to the headphones.As for comfort, the MDR-V6 is lighter than it looks, is adequately padded and stay's in place without feeling like it's been clamped to your head (a deal killer for me when I tried on a pair of Sennheiser HD-280 Pros).  The collapsible design makes it easy to transport, but the great price means you won't care as you can just buy extras to keep at work or wherever and save yourself the trouble of packing them up.My one gripe - and I admit to having no valid justification for this - is the long coiled chord.  When plugged into my Samsung Galaxy Media Player, the headphones dwarf the player, and the 9+ foot chord is far more than required to reach a player that is most likely in my pocket.  The MDR-XB500, on the other hand, features a flat chord less than half that length with an &#34;L&#34; shaped plug, all of which is better suited for a portable player.  But I wouldn't pick my headphones based on their chord style, and the MDR-V6 sounds great on the portable player, so I'll just live with the chord and remind myself that the V6s are monitors, not ear buds, and sound as different as they look.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value - beats headphones costing 3-4 times as much.", "unixReviewTime": 1369612800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2013"}

They've mostly been the cheap variety that come with portable units (Walkman, portable CD PLayers, portable radios) - most work OKm but the sound quality certainly hasn't been the best.I've also had \"good\" headphones for my home sound system.  I've used them to monitor recordings I was making and for just private listening.  These included headphones from Radio Shack that were Koss knockoffs where the liquid in the pads dried up.  Most recently I had a pair of Sony MDR-600's that I found in a local store and thought sounded pretty good.Then they broke and I found ecstasy in the Sony MDR-V6's.  When I first bought the '600's, I checked the reviews at the time.  Many said that the '600's were the replacement for the retired V6's - some moaned about the '600's quality compared to the V6's.  I'd already bought the '600's, and thought they were great, and I got a number of years satisfactory service from them.After a move, I dug my V600's out of the box they were packed in to find that the pads had deteriorated to non-usable status.  Despondent, I checked Amazon and found that the '600s were still available so I immediately ordered another pair.  That was last fall (2009).I'd barely gotten 6 months' service out of the new '600s when something happened to the connector that allowed the right earpiece to fold.  It kept coming apart.  After some investigation, I determined that they were still under Sony's warranty, and have sent them out to be repaired.Meantime, while poking around on Amazon's website I found that the V6's were once again available as new.  Researching further I found many glowing reviews and decided this time I'd do it right and order the V6's.  Once they arrived, I found audio bliss.Recordings that I was well familiar with suddenly sounded new again.  Details in the recordings I'd missed were suddenly apparent and my joys of listening to music have greatly increased.Maybe there are some really expensive headphones out there from other brands, but for what I'd call a value price, this pair of Sony MDR v6's has me all excited about my music collection again.The reviews that talk about the tightness and the \"hot ears syndrome\" are true.  Being a closed headphone, they fit around the ear and outsiders don't hear a thing, so I consider the tightness a plus.  \"Hot ears\"? - A small price to pay for the exquisite sound.I'm not sure what I'll do with the V600's when Sony returns them.  I'll do a comparison for sure, maybe keep that older pair in the bedroom for nighttime listening.  But for sure, the V6's will be my main goto headphones for years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Audio bliss", "unixReviewTime": 1272499200, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2010"}

Laser", "helpful": [49, 54], "reviewText": "The whole purpose of any quality audio reproduction system is to accurately reproduce sound - speakers or headphones should sound like music, not like hardware. They should not color the sound, or over / under emphasize or de-emphasize any part of the audio spectrum that human beings can hear.And when it comes to headphones, not only should they not color the sound, but they should be comfortable, so you can wear them for hours without developing sweaty ears or a headache. They should correctly fit your head, and the best headphones are \"cirumaural\" design like this which surround your ears and mask most external, ambient noise without so much pressure that it feels like your head is in a vise.There are more brands and models of headphones out there than I can count but.. I've owned a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones for probably twenty years. After buying and not being happy with various models of headphones made by Sennheiser, Stanton, Superex, Koss, and others.. someone turned me on to the Sony MDR-V6 I bought a pair at an audio store for about eighty bucks in the early 1980s.. Since then, I've never looked back..Not only are they the best sounding cans I've ever heard for triple the price, but since I've owned them I've never heard any better headphones, any brand, any model. Perhaps someday I'll hit the lottery and blow $4000.00 on a pair of Sony's MDR-R10 (fat chance).. Do NOT confuse the MDR-V6 with the slightly newer, slightly more expensive MDR-V600 headphones which sound highly inferior and cost more.Now think about it - can you name another model of anything that Sony has made continuously, basically unchanged, for over twenty years? There must be a reason. I've worn out two or three sets of the \"pleather\" ear pads on my V6s and happily, Sony's parts and accessories Web site still stocks them so if you need a pair of genuine replacement Sony ear pads for them, they are part number X-2113-124-1, about five bucks each, and you'll find them on Sony's DPAC site where they sell parts and accessories.These are simply the most bang for the buck I've ever spent on headphones and believe me, I've owned (and auditioned).. many brands, many models, and nothing I've ever owned or heard reproduced sound with such accuracy, transparency, crystalline sweet highs, beautiful mid-range, and prodigious bass as these. I've used them with my laptop, HiFi rig, portable players, you name it. On my laptop I plug them into an SRS WoW Thing box (no longer available from SRS Labs), crank up the box's \"TruBass\" knob and it's like listening to $10,000 speakers. (SRS WoW thing is implemented in quite a few software-based music players as a plug-in, such as WMP and WinAmp.. why they decided to stop making the WoW Thing box, I can't fathom, but it's a stupendous accessory if you can find one.. grab it!..)..But even without the spatial and bass enhancement the WoW Thing implements, I've lost count of how many friends I've had over on whose heads I've slapped the MDR-V6 headphones, played some wide-dynamic music for them and watched their jaws hit the floor. The first reaction is usually \"Holy ____!\" and then they ask, what are these, how much do they cost, where can I get them?I decided since mine were twenty years old, it might be a good idea to grab a new pair, as a back-up, since Sony still makes them, just in case they ever dropped them from their product line, so (true story).. last year, an eBay seller, you know, one of those liquidator types who has a bajillion auctions running at once, put up an auction for three pairs of MDR-V6s and mis-priced them at $14.95 a pair. I sat there staring at the screen thinking \"this can't be right, NO ONE sells these $100 cans that cheaply. Are they used? Refurbs? Defective?\" I checked his feedback, which was very positive, and said well, no guts no glory.. by the time I smacked the \"Buy it Now\" button to buy all three pairs, someone else had already snatched one, so I snagged two of them and sure enough, I got the right headphones - brand new, sealed in their Gold and red satin lined boxes, the same packaging my original pair came in twenty years ago.  The seller told me he had a bunch of high school kids entering auctions for him and someone had mis-priced them, and entered $14.95 instead of $74.95 but he would honor the much lower, wrong price.So if my original twenty year old pair ever fail, I have brand new ones on hand.Audiophiles get religious about headphones. They'll argue all day about which sound the best, which are the most comfy, which produce colored sound or accurate sound, which ones you can wear for hours, which ones hurt your head.. I've read hundreds of headphone reviews over the years and sure, some guys don't like the MDR-V6s for one reason or another, but I think that's usually a case of \"Well, I spent $xxx.xx for my Grados / AKGs / Sennheisers.. $100 Sonys can't possibly sound as good..\" and they're just trying to justify having spent that kind of money..You don't have to trust me, but if you're shopping for the best sounding headphones under $300.00, the Sony MDR-V6 are the headphones you want. Even at Amazon's price, even at their full retail of $100.00 in my opinion you simply will not find better sounding headphones of any kind. I run out of superlatives describing them. And for you guys who own an old pair and nead new ear pads, as I said above, you can get them off Sony's DPAC site for about five bucks each plus shipping.Once you slap these cans on your head and immerse yourself in their magnificent sound, you'll understand :) ..Pax et Lux", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best cans I have ever owned or heard", "unixReviewTime": 1172880000, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2007"}

I'm nowhere near an audiophile, just a guy who loves music and is lucky to have a job where I can listen to music all day. I needed a set of cans with good sound isolation, didn't leak a ton, sounded good to average ears, and didn't break the bank. Check, check, check and check.Before the V6s, I mostly used Apple earbuds, and every once in a while, my brother's Senn HD428s and Grado SR-60i's. Naturally, the V6s blew the Apples out of the water, that's not even a question. And to my ears, they're better than the Senn's too. They're clearer, brighter, and have less-boomy bass (admittedly, those last two things come down to personal taste). In interest of fairness, I will say they probably don't sound as good as the Grado's, but those are 2-3 times the price, and they're an on-ear design, which wouldn't really fit my sound isolation needs when at work.Addressing a couple complaints I saw in the reviews for the V6s:1. A lot have noticed that the pads don't last too long, and I found that to be the case for me too. One of my ear pads had completely split open along the inner seam and exposed the foam underneath within 3 months.2. I noticed a number of complaints about the comfort and fit, especially concerning a pinching feeling. I have a fairly large head (hat size 7 3/4), and so I initially worried about pulling the trigger on buying these. However, I've never experienced any pain or discomfort whatsoever when wearing these.In the end, I have a hard time believing I could have found a better sounding set of cans at this price (I grabbed them when they dipped to $65).

After reading a lot of reviews I noticed that a lot of people really love these phones. So I decided to give them a chance and went ahead and bought them from Amazon and made sure they were not counterfeit. I'm an audio producer so it is a must that I have a pair of great sound producing quality headphones but at the same time I want the best buy price. The reviews sure made it sound like these phones were the ones I'm looking for. After listening to them and comparing them to other headphones that I have, I came to the conclusion that these phones are not all that what people wrote about in the reviews. The bass and lows from the V6 does sound incredible but what got me was the treble and highs. Don't get me wrong, this pair of headphones did beat most of my other headphones I have except for one, my Monster Beat Tour in-ear headphones. Now, I know people must be thinking that it is not fair to compare in-ear headphones to over ear headphones but I figured since the V6s are considered studio monitor headphones, also having a lot bigger drivers, they would have better sound than the small in-ear Beats Tour. So I will compare these two. I tested both exactly the same. The V6 did have the advantage in the bass by only a few hairs. But when it came down to the treble or highs, the Beats Tour wins by a mile. The mids and highs in the Beats Tour are super crisp and defined. The mids and highs in the V6s are not all that great plus the volume is a lot lower. I understand that in-ear headphones require less power, but still the V6s could have been better and lived up to the title of Studio Monitor. I give it 3 stars out of 5 because the bass does sound great and the price is fair. I guess when it comes down to quality sound headphones you get what you pay for as the Monster Beats Tour in-ear headphones cost me $150 and the V6 cost me $68. I would most likely use the Beats Tour for monitoring more than the V6.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sound quality not what I expected.", "unixReviewTime": 1306195200, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2011"}

I originally bought a pair of Sony MDR V600 headphones. They were a little cheaper than these but seemed to be a good pair. And they were. Their sound was beautiful. It was crisp and clear with deep powerful bass and smooth highs. My only problems with the 600's was that after about an hour my ears would start to hurt. That and they wouldn't fit well under my welding helmet.So I returned the 600's and continued my research towards which headphones to buy. I wanted a closed circumaural design to not only block out outside noises, but also because I have sensitive ears, and circumaural would be more comfortable for me. I came across these headphones and after reading positive review after positive review, I decided to throw down a little extra cash and purchase them.I couldn't be more pleased! The sound of these cans is simply incredible. Especially out of my stereo. They are the best sounding headphones I've ever worn in this price range. They sound a little weaker running out of a portable cd player than my receiver, but they still can pack quite a wallop. It just loses a little of the crispness out my discman.The only negative aspect I've heard of from these headphones is that the earcups will start to disintegrate after YEARS of use. This hasn't happened to mine yet, although I've only had them for about 6 months so far. That is such a minimal and easily replacable problem (You can purchase replacement earcups online) that I'm not worried about it.These headphones can be worn for hours without much discomfort, which is impressive to me as my ears are very sensitive.

The coiled cord however would alleviate some of the clutter.Upon ordering this product, I got it within 3 days.

If your experience with headphones has been limited to whatever was packaged with your portable player, you'll be amazed at how these open up the experience of listening to music.You can get a more detailed sound out of headphones, but these are remarkably good for the price.  Considering the prevalence of these headphones in studio environments, they've become somewhat of a standard.  You could get better, but you'd have to spend considerably more money.These headphones also shine in their efficiency.  Essentially a headphone's efficiency relates to how much volume of sound is produced by a given amount of input.  This is probably one of the most important specs to concern yourself with in headphones.  Many portable audio devices have relatively low-powered outputs that are not able to adequately drive larger headphones.  Most can drive these Sonys very well.Some have complained about these headphones being prone to falling apart.  I disagree.  While mine have taken a beating, I've also taken them all over the place on my travels and used them heavily for years.  From salty and humid tropical beaches to far too many airplane flights, these headphones have accompanied me.  If you've worn out these headphones it's probably due to the fact that you've subjected these headphones to far more use than any previous headphone.Lastly, these headphones are a bargain price.  You can't easily find headphones this good under $100.If you use personal audio devices or enjoy a lot of media while at the computer, do yourself a favor and order these headphones.  They will open the detail of the music to you in a way that will pleasantly surprise you.

I'm hearing bass notes that I've never heard before in a pair of headphones, and what's amazing is that the bass doesn't overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound.  I tested on my laptop and my iPod and set the EQ to flat on both, and the sound is near perfectly balanced: no muddy bass, weak midtones or tinny highs, just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experience.The phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear.  The padding on the cups is thinner than on past models, which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head, but they're every bit as comfortable as the older V600's that I replaced.  The headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player.  It comes with a 3.5mm to 1/4\" adapter so that you can plug it into full-size headphone jacks on stereos.  If you're going to use it on a home stereo, I'd recommend getting a 6-10' extension cord for it, unless of course you can sit close to your receiver.These are an incredible deal in my opinion.

I worked for a couple years as a radio deejay and these are as excellent a pair as you'll find in any studio. I base my review on what I was looking for in a new pair of headphones, so I hope it's useful to you all.Weight: These headphones feel fairly heavy, but not smash-my-hair-down heavy, and they feel like they're actually made of something, rather than some dinky headphones one might get at a major department store, such as Walmart or Target (often stores carry the lower-price items that will sell better; thus, they usually have smaller parts and are lower quality.Adjustability: These headphones are very easy to adjust and set to however you want them. When I put them on the first time, it took just about ten or fifteen seconds to slide them up a bit enough to fit my head, and because of the way the earpieces are hinged to the top part, when I take them off, I'm not &#34;peeling&#34; them off, so to speak, but rather I can pull the earpieces directly away from my ears and they move easily without feeling like I'm going to break them.Comfort / Sound Leakage: The earpiece cushions completely encase the ear, much unlike many of the $30-or-so models in the department stores (yes, Sony too), so they have a sort of airtight feel to them. In fact, there is almost no sound leakage from the outside in. When I'm typing on my computer, I cannot hear the click noises from my keyboard, even with the volume level set fairly low. From the headphones out, they do leak a little sound, but it is really minimal, and would likely not be an issue at all if the volume is moderate or lower.Sound Quality: Simply put, these are the headphones many professional sound technicians use, and I assure you they sound absolutely killer. The frequency range is excellent and reveals many subtle sounds of my music that I didn't even know were in the songs when I was listening through my last pair of headphones. The bass is muscular and sturdy without feeling strained. The midtones are honest-to-goodness clear and unimpeded, and the higher tones come through ultra crisp and clean.All in all, I don't regret one cent of this purchase. Also, I'm glad to know that this model of headphones has been around for years, which, to me says much more about their quality than anything I could write in this review. There are even replacement ear cushions available online if you need them. There is even a &#34;pleather&#34; travel bag that comes with them!

First for a bit of background.As I've been getting more into music (Library is at 18000 songs and counting), I've really gotten picky about sound quality. The past few years I've moved up from $10 earbuds to $20 on-ears to $40 over-ears, but my last pair were terribly constructed and snapped. I used to be pretty negligent towards bitrate, and now I only get 320kbps or FLAC if I can help it. The sound card for my computer has a great audio management system, and I figured if I'm going to get into this whole music thing, I might as well go all the way. I couldn't afford crazy-good Sennheisers and I knew beats were just trendy, so I hit up amazon for some research and found these.I am not disappointed. At all. There's a reason this model has lasted decades. I read a couple of the top reviews and I saw people have been using these longer than I've been alive. That's when I knew I had a winner, so I bought them. Onto the meat of the review.Sound:Overall- Absolutely superb. I can't say I've ever experienced owning $500+ headphones or anything, but I'm also not won over by artificial bass boosting or anything. Every genre of music sounds beautiful. After a few weeks of breaking them in, I tried testing these beautiful headphones and they did not fail. Dubstep, Trance, Prog Rock, Hip Hop, Folk, Pop, Jazz, Piano, etc. I've tried out every genre I can think of and it's played it back beautifully.Bass- Awesome. Subsonic bass is a tiny bit lacking, but I'm being real picky here. They're headphones, not subwoofers. Low-to-mid range bass is amazing, I really noticed it listening to Electro/House music. It sounds great and you can really feel it.Mids- Dope. My cheaper headphones failed at the mid-bass and mid-treble range, this pair I can definitely tell the difference.Highs- Great range on the highs. Can play high sounds without screeching/sounding tinny, and you can really hear the small fluctuations in highs.Virtualization- I'm going to clump in instrument isolation and sound localization here. I'm not exactly sure on the vocab but bear with me. I've never been in a recording studio, but these headphones isolate instruments wonderfully. Again, not an expert opinion, but I can definitely tell the difference compared to other cheaper headphones. For sound localization, I also play games with these on. I told Skyrim to treat them as a 7.1 Surround system and by god, it's like I was really there. I tested this by talking to a character and standing in front of a waterfall, then rotating my character in a slow circle while closing my eyes. I could really hear the sound going a full 360 degrees around me, no gaps or jumps in the sound. I could pinpoint enemies by distance and direction from hearing their footsteps. This was a totally unexpected bonus.Build:Comfort- Definitely comfortable. They're not exactly memory foam mattress status though. I usually take a 5 minute break or so every hour or two while listening to them, but even for 4 hour marathon stretches they never hurt, they just get a bit uncomfortable. I'm a 6'0 guy with average ear size and the pads fit completely around my ears, they don't squish them down into my head. They are closed, so your ears are bound to get a little hot and sweaty. But you can't avoid that. Another problem I had with other headphones was that the headband got uncomfortable. These definitely don't. They're a bit heavy thanks to the metal construction, but they never feel like they're weighing my head down or anything. I've never experienced discomfort with the headband pressing down too hard, or the pads squishing too hard.Quality- Very high quality. Nothing feels flimsy at all, there are no joints that are prone to breakage (I'm an engineer, take my word) and nothing feels cheap. Again, people have owned these for decades.Cord- Apparently stretches to like 11 feet, I've never tried it. Coiled up, its are about five feet long from the jack to where it connects with the headphones. The jack is really sturdy metal so it's a tad heavy. I did find it annoying that the cord is not removable. I have a cord with volume control that's only a few feet long which is much more convenient for listening on-the-go. However, this isn't bad. The coils fit inside my pockets rather easily, and the cord itself is thick and feels like it's not breaking any time soon.Other thoughts: Buy these. For reals. I can't believe this quality is available at this price. I don't like taking these off. I didn't used to listen to music while walking to class, but I can't resist now that I have these headphones. I used to prefer my 5.1 speaker setup when at my desk, now I only use them when I have people over. These headphones are amazing for music and gaming, and I definitely know I made the right choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hot damn", "unixReviewTime": 1336348800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2012"}

The V6 is a happy exception, and certainly worth the price of admission.MONITORS?A genuine one must allow you to hear every last detail of the sound/voice/music:--the sound of the reverb of the radio studio--whether or not the announcer is using a pop and/or wind filter--how far from the mike the announcer's mouth is--what brand of mike is being used (for music, Neumann U87 or AKG have a distinctive sound)--mike placement in relation to a large chorus and/or symphony orchestra--acoustics/reverb-time of the performance venue--be able to hear individual tracks in a multi-track overdubYes, YesThere are not many headphones that meet these requirements, but the V6 certainly qualifies with flying colors, regardless of the cost. My old standard, AKG K340 Electrostatic/Dynamic, has long since given up the ghost, but these are a more than adequate substitution (besides, the K340 was a wee bit bright, but the V6 is much more flat).This is both good and bad: really good recordings will sound even better, but bad recordings will sound even worse.ERGONOMICSThe plug is solid aluminum rather than black plastic, but is straight rather than bent.The cord is long, and half of it is coiled, so you get plenty of running room, but is no good for on-the-go uses.Despite the conventional design, it is one of the lightest and most comfortable I have ever used. Many hours of non-stop usage is not unreasonable for this pair.The pads are large and surround your entire ear but are certainly not isolating.

Ever since I was a kid and jammed on my Walkman, I've always sprung for the cheapest pair I could find as price was more expedient to me than quality. The most expensive kind I've ever bought were two sets of $30 cans from either Sony or Panasonic, each of which broke less than six months after I bought them because they were cheap and shoddily-made. For the last five years, I've primarily subsisted on the set of white earbuds that come standard with all Apple products. After accidentally sending my current earbuds through the washing machine for the second time, I threw them away and thought, &#34;I think it's finally time to upgrade.&#34;But what to upgrade to? For weeks prior, I had been enticed by headphones by Beats by Dre and Bose, easily the most recognizable and popular headphone brands today, and they were indeed a step up from the Apple buds in terms of sound. However, before I dropped $300 on a new pair of phones, I did some research on Amazon, and boy howdy, was I glad I didn't just pick &#34;what sounded nice&#34; in the store. Not only was it consistently made clear that the quality on Beats and Bose models were not all that great, it was also made apparent to me that one could obtain a superior set for less than a third of the price. I researched hard for a week, hemming and hawing between the MDR-V6, the MDR-7506, and the Audio Technica ATH-M50s (twice the price of the other two at $160), but I finally settled on the V6 for a nice primer into the world of audiophilia.Many other reviewers make the note that both the V-6 and the 7506 have been around for decades and are both widely used in the TV, music, and radio industries thanks to their clear, even sound (and, probably, their low selling price). Even fresh out of the lovely gold box with red velvet interior trimming (a sign that you're about to embark on a real musical journey very soon), they sounded heavenly compared to what I've been used to. I'm not yet through the fabled &#34;burn-in&#34; period yet as I just received these two days ago, but if they get any better than they are already, I imagine that I'll experience something similar to Dante ascending the staggered tiers of Paradise.To get the most out of your listening experience with these headphones, either listen to original sources like CDs or vinyl or, when copying from these sources, do so in a &#34;lossless&#34; format like FLAC or Apple Lossless. Like most people, I had zero idea that when songs are converted to MP3, they are greatly compressed and lose their original quality. Listening to my collection of MP3s and comparing them to lossless sound, it was as though I was listening to a great-sounding band from behind a glass window -- I could hear them just fine, but the sound is somewhat muffled, and there are background effects that are cut out. Lossless songs, on the other hand, sound much richer and fuller than MP3s -- almost three-dimensional. With headphones like these, you're really doing yourself a service by updating your library to lossless as I'll be in the process of doing for the next several months. True, they can be anywhere from twice to four times their tiny MP3 size, but given how cheap and plentiful hard drive space is these days, I'm really not complaining.Also, with the V-6's, you'll really begin to appreciate both professionaly-produced modern recordings and older music that has been remastered. For instance, I listened to the '87 version of U2's &#34;The Joshua Tree.&#34; It still sounds just fine, but since it's such an old CD, the sound seems very flat and 2D. With newer or remastered music, I was elevated to a new level of audio listening. Hearing Jimi Hendrix rocking his Stratocaster on &#34;All Along the Watchtower,&#34; the luscious opening piano notes to Fleetwood Mac's &#34;Songbird,&#34; or the discordant, gouging riff that ends Nine Inch Nails' &#34;Hurt&#34; as though everybody I'm listening to is there in the room with me is quite the experience. For years, I had no idea that music could sound this good.In terms of the make and build of the V-6's, I'm extremely happy. Gone are the cheap, dinky molding of the headphones of my youth. These are made with a much stronger, durable plastic, and they feel like they're made to last. The cans themselves are comfy, and I don't experience any of the head-pinching that some get from the headband. Note that these aren't totally noise-cancelling, but they do let you rock out while lying in bed next to someone who's sleeping. Many, many times already, people having been talking to me, and I've had to kill the sound and take them off in order to understand what was being said.About the cord: It comes either coiled or straight. I chose coiled because, well, it just looks gangster, like you know what you're doing (which I barely do, but anyway). It's also 10 feet long, which negatively rubs individuals' respective rhubarb. Honestly, I'm a tall guy at 6'3&#34;, and I've had my fill of tiny cords that yank my head down even though I've just got my music player tucked into my pants pocket. I appreciate the extra cord and the added ability to move around even if I'm plugged into my computer.Everything considered, I'm very, very happy with the Sony MDR-V6. Maybe one day I'll spring for the Audio Technica ATH-M50s to see if they're that much better, but for right now, I'm pretty well set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Like listening to music for the first time", "unixReviewTime": 1378684800, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2013"}

I read dozens of reviews on several websites regarding high end Headphones. When I narrowed it down to two models I decided to let the Amazon reviews decide which I should trust. After reading Amazons reviews & seeing there was a 1 year warranty I selected the Sony MDR-V6.The GoodFrom the moment I opened the box I was impressed. All the trimmings that came with these headphones were top notch. The second I put these on I was in love, They felt amazingly comfortable and sounded perfect. From the headband to the ear cups they are very sturdy & feel pleasant. I have never owned high end headphones before & these seemed to be worth there weight in gold. I have heard reviews knocking the base & other aspects of the sound & I totally disagree with them.The BadLike I implied earlier it was love from first sight, But like all young lovers I thought it would last forever. It did not... It lasted all of five months. It was not a slow decline, There were no warning signs. One day my partner in crime was delivering the sweet sounds of Tobias Sammet & the next a single earcup was delivering the sound. I was distressed assuming somehow I had damaged my headphones and I reached to take them off my head & as I did they were playing perfectly. So I un-stretched the top potion of the wire and half of my sound dissapeard. The wiring had some how failed. Over the next day I without stretching them I lost sound in both ear cups & then regained a distorted whisper from both cups.The UglyWhen I attempted to begin the process of redeeming my warranty I was shocked to find out that It only had a limited \"Parts only\" Warranty & I will be required to pay 39.99 to potentially get a \"Similar\" model or a  \"Refurbished\" replacement. I was planing on giving them a five star review 6 months from purchase date, Instead they get a one star review. A faulty product is not worth its weight in complimentary mints. I have not finished the return, Once I do I will update this review.UpdateI called Sony & even though it took about an hour of talking/waiting the people working at customer service were top notch. The three people I talked with were very nice and helpful. They helped walk me through the return process and waived the 40 dollar fee. I'm not sure If it was my particular circumstances or if its always their policy to waive a fee if someone complains.

I like that I can plug straight into basically any headphone output and rock (or soft-rock if necessary); the uncolored response gives the V6s good versatility in my opinion; i'm not interested in artificially-enhanced bass or anything, just accurate sound.In my research I've found that a lot of these headphones from the early 90s are still kicking around with just an earpad replacement. The cord and plug are sturdy, which is important to me because I have been burned (not literally) by cheap cords in the past. I wish the earpieces could be locked into place instead of flopping around... wouldn't be hard to twist them laterally, so fold them up when not in use. The loops of cord above the earpieces might get taped/glued down or ziptied, because if they get snagged (could happen on a guitar tuning peg or something. I have this kind of luck) it would be ugly. I have no problem wearing em for 4+ hours at a time, but eventually my ears and temples start getting sore. By then it's time for a break from vegging around anyway. I will be putting the velour replacement pads on to see what happens.Headphones are a pretty subjective subject, so your mileage may vary. Try some out at a store if you can.

I did not hear the \"punchy bass\" people were talking about in the reviews. I like to be immersed in my music. I want to feel like I'm inside the song. But the bass in these phones couldn't deliver that feeling, as hard as I tried to like them.2. The highs are too high for me. It hurt my ears.3. The cord is way too long for commuting.

This makes traveling on the subway with them very awkward.Some music I typically listen to (so you get an idea of the sound I was looking for):- Radiohead- Grizzly Bear- Wilco- Fleet Foxes- My Morning JacketIn summary, I think these are great for sound technicians who need to hear every click and scratch and need the extra long cord so they can move around the studio. They're sturdy and extremely comfortable. But if you're looking for a pair of commuter-friendly headphones with deep sonic immersion, I don't think these are for you.EDIT: I respect these headphones for their longevity and their devout following.

Whenever I use these for DJ'ing, I can move around pretty freely without worrying that the headphone jack will pop out.One thing that I read about and that happened to me is that when I kept the headphones on for about 10 minutes, my ears would get hot and feel a bit sweaty.The padding for the headband doesnt feel that padded when you touch it, but when you put on the headphones, it would feel somewhat comfortable.The one conveniet thing is that the headphones flip upside down, but I usually don't use that feature. Also, the extendor of the headphones is metal, so you don't have to worry about the extendor breaking, unless you abuse the hell out of it.A second thing that I worry about is the exposed wire. Between the headband and the earphone, there is a wire that is exposed and out there. It looks pretty frail to me, and if it ever gets damaged, you have to get another pair of headphones, unless you bought a warranty.Onto to Sound!Overall, the sound quality is pretty good. I usually listen to hip hop, dubstep, R&B;, and house music, and the sound quality is pretty good. The mids are clear, the highs are good, and the lows are full.

I absolutely love these cans. I didn't want to review the day after I received until I used them on stage, in the studio, etc. I now can say these are one of the best cans you can get for your money for a clear signal with realistic sound.They are very sturdy feeling and can compact nicely to stow and go in their included travel bag. The ear muffs (if that's what their called) won't last forever, but that is the reality to face with any padded phones. It happens. Sony sells replacements to solve that problem, guaranteeing you can keep these phones for a long, long, long time. Additionally, the coiled cord is a HUGE plus in my opinion. The cord can extend a good 10+ feet fully extended. There isn't much pull either so the cord can easily be extended without needing to \"break it in\". I can easily walk around and not feel the pull on the phones, which to me is huge when walking around adjusting gear when playing live or practicing. Also as a standard professional set of phones would, it includes a screw-on 1/4\" adapter which is also a huge plus to me. This ensures I can know when I roam about that the phones stay plugged in and I can focus on performing.The phones are surprisingly excellent at blocking out sound when over your ears. I actually have to take one off my ear when playing live to hear across stage because it silences other sound out so well. But for everyone looking to be immersed into the sound at the moment - be it a film, music, video game, radio, video monitor, etc, these literally place you in the studio or right where the microphone was placed in the musical recording. They have a great range of sound so when I use them to take apart keys or strings, I can hear the bassy lows and shrilly highs. On a guitar it has the same effect. Greatest sound reproduction I've come across... And have no reason to look for anything else.Be warned, these are not bass boosting (over emphasizing, in my opinion) Beats audio headphones. So if you're looking to shake the dust and wax out of your ears, don't get these. These produce sound the way it is, no extra enhancements.

I spent a great deal of time pouring through reviews on various headphone fanatic websites and many of the reviews on here.  My initial conclusion was that I should go ahead and purchase the Sennheiser HD 555s, which I did as part of an awesome deal during Black Friday.  Unfortunately, despite their amazing sound and great look, the Sennheiser HD 555s were open ear and actually quite uncomfortable.  Unlike most people, I have a slightly larger head, so I ALWAYS end up extending the headphones as far as they can come out of the headband.  The Sennheisers simply had too much pressure on my head, actually causing a small bit of pain after a wearing them for a while.There are essentially 4 factors I look for in a great pair of headphones:(1) Excellent sound reproduction in a wide range of frequencies (especially great bass)(2) Very comfortable for long periods of listening (while wearing glasses)(3) Closed-ear (so that I don't disturb people nearby)(3) Semi-PortabilityI ultimately returned them and replaced them with the Sony MDR-V6s.  I was definitely somewhat skeptical that these smaller, closed-ear Sony's were not going to live up to the Sennheisers.  Let me tell you, THEY DO.The sound quality of the MDR-V6s is amazing.  Granted they are only 76$ headphones, they make the music come alive and I'm honestly hearing new parts of songs that were lost to other inferior headphones.  Their bass reproduction is fantastic, with a claim that they can actually go down to 3 Hz, as opposed to the typical 20 Hz cut-off of most headphones.  I'm a definite bass-o-phile, so I know my bass.  You can crank it up and not even hear distortion at very low frequencies.  In addition, you cannot hear any sound outside of them when you are wearing them.  Much to my surprise, they are very comfortable (even with glasses on), much more so than the Sennheisers, and the pressure on my head is much less.  They are also built very study, more so than it appears the Sennheisers were.  Lastly, they fold up very compactly and even come with a nice leather carrying pouch.  (Funnily enough, they came resting on a bed of red silk in their original packaging; very ostentatious Sony).The only negative aspect that I can find at the moment is that your ears get a little warm after a while, but this is often the case with most over-the-ear headphones.  In addition, I prefer cables that aren't coiled, but it's not a big deal; it's actually often convenient.Bottom line: great value, great sound, comfortable, portable.  If you don't own a recording studio or DJ professionally (although I imagine some use these), you cannot go wrong with these.  I thoroughly believe based on the many reviews that they will bring many years of pleasure.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Replacement for Sennheiser", "unixReviewTime": 1291334400, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2010"}

The soundscape on the MDR-V6 is very nice if you are into the more natural vocal spectrum.  Some may say the bass is weak, but that is not the case.  I believe this are tuned for more accurate music interpretations.  The bass is fine in the highs & mids, in the lows is where you will feel bass a little flat in the lower registers.  A lot of headphones now-a-days have been overly tuned to be bass-heavy to satisfy the younger ipod/mp3 generation.  For this price range, these headphones should be considered as a top choice.  After the burn-in/break in period, this headphones keep sounding better.  The fit is great, initially a little tight but will stretch for a comfortable fit the more you use it.  The pleather/leatherish earphone covers are quite soft.  Long term use will cause your ears to get warm/hot and maybe a little sweaty, but that is typically with almost all closed-ear headphones.

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Unbeatable value", "unixReviewTime": 1073088000, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2004"}

Not sure how people kill them so much faster, but I think high temperatures, hair products (the chemicals in a lot of products destroy plastic), and definitely sun light (which is evil to anything plastic/vinyl) will do them in quicker.

If you buy these and find them too tight, you can gently bend the headband, just make sure you're grasping the metal and nothing plastic!-There are, sadly, counterfeit versions of these being sold everywhere online, and they've even popped up from third-party retailers on Amazon.

It is difficult to believe (unless you've used these Sony's yourself) that any headphones can look so cool, be so comfortable, cost so little (relatively), and sound so good.  I listen to jazz, rock, reggae, classical, show tunes - pretty much anything, and no musical genre is shortchanged.  While high and middle notes are reproduced with exceptional quality and accuracy, it is absolutely amazing how well bass notes are rendered.  Listening to the double low C at the beginning of \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" is an experience not to be missed, and is especially remarkable because of the absolute lack of the doubling usually encountered with small diameter (relatively) acoustic transducers.  Breathtaking.  Buy 'em - you'll be glad you did.Update:  December 30, 2012Love these headphones, and it looks like I always will, but I have found a way to make them even better. Here is a review I wrote on improving the Sony MDR-V6 headphones:I bought these ear cushionsBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)for my Sony MDR-V6 phones and could not be happier. The Sony cushions are certainly good, in fact are a cut well above average, but the Beyerdynamic's are still a clear step above even them. Wearing the Sony's with the original cushions for more than an hour left my ears a bit sore, especially at the very top and bottom where they were slightly pinched. The Beyerdynamics, however, allow me to wear the MDR's indefinitely with zero discomfort. I don't know if it's the slightly larger size of these cushions, or the material they're made from, but it's like wearing air - you simply don't notice their physical presence. And there is an additional benefit: for whatever reason, probably because of the superior seal these cushions make against your head, bass frequencies are enhanced over the already excellent bass produced by the Sony's. In fact, to make the expression of bass consistent with mid and high frequencies I found using an equalizer helpful. The lowered requirement for the headphone amp to produce bass frequencies allows it to reserve energy it can then use to support a wider, and more accurate, dynamic range. A win-win situation all because of better ear cushions!In an earlier review I read about how to install the Beyerdynamic ear cushions. Nevertheless, I approached the job with more than a little trepidation, worried that I'd end up with a pretty but non-functioning pile of junk. Not to worry though, a good tug removed the originals and installing the new was a pretty obvious procedure. Glad I did it! And yes, at least for the Sony headphones, toss the plastic flanges that come in the package.

Bottom line is the sound quality is incredible. Much better than my portable Shure SE530 earphones. Compared to my friends Beats by Dre, these are just as \"open\" sounding regarding the soundstage. I would say the treble is much more crisp and refined, but not sharp. The bass is tighter and deeper, but overall less powerful. If you enjoy extremely high levels of bass, to the point where it muddies the other frequencies, either get a FAT amplifier and run full bass on the EQ, or buy different headphones...you don't deserve this amazing quality!Comfort was the only thing worth noting here. The original earpads have gotten a bunch of criticism in the reviews.When I received these headphones, I did a 10 hour burn in. When i first listened to them, they sounded average. I went online and downloaded files specifically designed for headphone break-in (white noise, pink noise, frequency range sweeps, etc.). Needless to say, after the break in the headphones rose to their true potential.THOSE WHO DOUBT THE LEGITIMACY OF HEADPHONE BREAK-IN SHOULD READ UP! IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF YOU ENJOY ACCURATE SOUND REPRODUCTION.The earpads were somewhat disappointing, they seemed like some really (too) soft foam wrapped in material with the consistency of a garbage bag but thinner. It was sad and seemed very prone to tearing. It was not uncomfortable for me however, after wearing them for 2 hours or so. No sweat, ache, etc.Despite no complaints I still decided to purchase the aftermarket beyerdynamic earpads. And wow what a difference. Bass is deeper, sound isolation improved, makes the headphones feel lighter, and much more comfortable. The material that covers the foam is excellent. I wouldn't have expected less, these new earpads are German made, the same nation that is renowned for making excellent earplugs so you can sleep on airplanes!They cost me less than 20 dollars, and considering how long you will keep these headphones (did i mention they sound great?) it would be a wise-investment to give your ears a lounge while they are absorbing the great sounds emitted from the drivers.DONT SECOND GUESS YOURSELF!

If you want full sound and don't want to pay a ton for the popular headphones of the day, these fit the bill perfectly.  Amazon was selling at an unbelievable price, so I jumped on them.I got them because I a don't really like earbuds, preferring headphone style as they stay put and sound better as a result.  That said, I returned these because the pleather material Sony uses on the parts that touch one's ear get very warm and cause the ears to sweat.  It ended up making my whole head feel warm.  I guess I am a hothead, but I don't know how people say they can wear them for 10 hours comfortably.  I could have gone to the trouble of buying the $24 beyerdynamic velour earpad replacements others suggested which are more comfortable and won't eventually flake off, but really had no interest in upgrading something brand new.  Sony should charge a bit more and make it right the first time.For now, I'll continue to use the no longer made Sony sports headphones I have had for 10 years which work for me much better than earbuds, stay cool and allow me to run or commute while wearing them all while sounding better than earbuds, though not quite as good as these did.  When they break, I'll cry since the style is no longer available and have to hope someone makes something reasonably priced, comfortable and full sounding at that point.Look, most people rave about these so don't let this review discourage you, as all headphones of this style may be hot and uncomfortable and may just not work for me.

Overall, for a price of 65$,  you will be glad you bought these. They will last you years and years.The only slight problem, as many of the other reviews say, are that the cups are a little smaller than the other closed design headphones, such as the Bose QuietComfort. These headphones, unless you have very small ears, will probably not fit all the way around your ears. I don't agree that they are very tight though. I feel they are perfectly fine in tightness, just that the cups are a little small. But like many of the other reviews, you can't argue with the sound quality.

The sound is very good, with solid bass response and crisp highs, but they actually hurt my ears (physically, not aurally) if I leave them on too long...which usually equates in to anything more than 15 minutes.For the record, my hat size is a 7 1/4, so I would say the overall size of my head is average. A person with a larger head size may find even more discomfort in a shorter amount of wear time.In the past I had used the less expensive Sony Monitor headphones found in department stores. The sound was adequate, but I felt I wanted something more professional. These are definitely a step up from the Sony department store models, but same uncomfortable ear fitment.The bonus to these is they fold up nice and compact for better storage, so I don't have to worry so much about breaking them. They also come with an inexpensive little carrying pouch for added protection.Bottom line: Sound great, but uncomfortable for periods of long listening.*** 7/23/2013 UPDATE ***These did not last long.

{"reviewerID": "A1RFV4GLOA3O4V", "asin": "B00001WRSJ", "reviewerName": "Konstantin", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Let me begin by saying that this was my first foray into quality headphones. Previously, I would use crappy earphones that have been passed down or that I'd find here and there, I've never paid much attention to the quality of my music. I've tested out different ones at B&H; - best place to go to if you want to actually listen to headphones before buying them. I guess J&R; is the same but I haven't been there yet. And after a long search, I am so, so glad that I chose these headphones.I'll preface by saying that these headphones require burning in. However, it's not a mechanical burn-in that I'm talking about, as I've had a set for a couple weeks, and then I returned them to get a better price from Amazon, so I've tested a new set with a \"burned-in\" set and they actually pretty much the same in terms of overall quality (I was surprised, since I expected some change in sound - I'll get to that in a bit). No, the burn-in is for the most part psychological. Expect about a week of listening before you get to the good stuff. But what a sound they create after getting used to them.The trebles are sharp and sparkly. Some complain about sibilance. They are right - there is sibilance, but it does not take anything away at all from the overall quality of the sound, and when the music calls for it, you hear it well - as you should. The mids are pronounced and easily discernible from one another - it's easy to tell between mid range instrumentation. And the bass is exceptionally clean and warm. It isn't boomy or muddy and it doesn't bleed into the upper registers. Depending on the track and how it was recorded, I've heard instances where I didn't so much hear the bass but felt it coming from within me. The soundstage is pleasingly large and airy for a closed headphone. Speaking of that, when music is playing, it doesn't leak out. That is, you can use these in a quiet library without bothering anybody.However, to be fair I will have to point out some cons in these cans. And they exist. First, if you are going to use these headphones outside, do yourself a favor and spare yourself the hassle. The card is super long, coiled, and somewhat heavy. You won't find a place to put it unless you have really large pockets. The way these are built, even though you can fold them, there really isn't a very neat way of storing them. They come with a pouch, but to be honest it's not very useful as I find it isn't big enough to contain the entire set. These are indoor headphones, plain and simple. Second, the ear pads may tend to hurt after some time of listening as the drivers are pretty close. But hear me out here. If you do go ahead and get these, do yourself a huge favor and get the Beyerdynamic Velour Padded Earcushions. Not only do these improve comfort as well as appearance (the headphones really do look like they would cost at least $30-50 more), but they also add some EQ to the sound for those who don't like a flat monitor sound. The only thing is they reduce the bass a little bit, but I didn't find this to be a huge letdown. Otherwise, sibilance is improved, mids are tighter, cleaner sound as the velour considerably dampens any lingering sound. This is a good thing. When the music calls for an abrupt stop, there is actually silence. When there is too much going on in the music, it helps to differentiate between tonality and timbre. Installation of the velour pads was somewhat aggravating, but with a bit of patience, you can get them on.Ah, one more thing. I've mentioned I had a pair of these for about 2 weeks before getting a replacement to get a better price. I have found through testing both that the sound was only somewhat different. Now, I can't be too sure whether it was burn-in or just differentiation between the two, and I've read other reviews that mention that each V6 sounds different. The burned-in pair had more sibilance, the new one has more bass. Could be that the bass went away - however, my impression is that burn-in improves rather than removes bass. But your mileage may vary. Between the two though, after installing the velour pads, they sound equally amazing.I can safely say that these headphones redefined my listening experience. I am enjoying music I've heard before so many times, but now in a new and different light. If you are going into quality headphones, I highly, highly recommend these. They will not break your wallet, and have been around for 2 decades - there's a reason for that.GET THEM!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Redefined my music listening experience", "unixReviewTime": 1336521600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2012"}

I like the coiled cord, as opposed to the linear cord from my previous Sony MDR-V100.  I often wear these for well over 8 hours/day and find NO discomfort from the material or pressure exerted on my ears.Sound: With no playback, I notice immediately these cancel (or isolate) faint outside noise.  With music playing at medium volume, I am virtually 'deaf' to the outside world.  I often find myself wearing them throughout the day with no sound playing just to have that feeling of absolute silence.

In truth, It seems that the quality of your listening experience is only limited by the data rate of what you're listening to.  The only drawback, however, is the lack of thumpin' bass.

They look great! I don't feel like a dork while wearing them around other people.Comfort- I have a pretty sensitive head and hearing, and I have never gotten a headache, neck-ache, or discomfort while wearing them. They are very comfy and fit nicely around my ears. One thing I think happens with all headphones is your ears get pressed feeling, so its good to take them off for a few minutes then put them back on.

I am kinda a bass head, but these don't rumble and distort the music, no sound drowned out the other, it's all equally balanced to where you hear and feel the impact of the music, it so hard to describe, but it's amazing. You can happily use these with a mp3 device and it will sound amazing, but if you plug them into a computer or something that has stronger output, they will bring out so much more.

The players' breathing and scuffling in the quiet passages of a string quartet were clearly discernable (as they would be if the players were giving a private concert in my living room).I bought these primarily based on the reviews on amazon - so this one is only adding to the existing positive chorus. The sole design flaw seems to be the headband, that only touches the head at one point. They seem to be comfortable anyway, and to be fair, this is a traditional headphone design. The split headband with soft fabric surmounting the head, and a separate spring above, exemplified by the Bang and Olufsen Form 1, the RCA WHR 120, and others, may be more comfortable over long periods. However, recently in a local record store, I noticed that the headphones provided for customers to sample the records before purchase were this very model.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2014"}

No need at all for an amplifier.CON - When putting the headphones on, my fingers sometimes get caught in the exposed wires leading to each can. I've learned that when one of my fingers can't let go of the headphones after putting them on, to stop and gently pull whichever finger is caught out of the wire loop lest I rip the wire out of the can.The pleather earpads that come with the V6s tended to make my ears REALLY hot and sweaty in summer weather. I replaced them with a pair of Beyerdynamic Velour Padded Earcushions for the DT-250 from B&H; Photo. Big improvement in comfort and sound quality, especially comfort. The Beyerdynamic pads are cooler and more transparent to sound than the pleather pads that come with the V6s. I should have ordered the Beyerdynamic pads at the same time I ordered the V6 phones and replaced the original pads immediately. When i get my backup MDR-V6 I'm going to do just that.Summary - If your taste in sound tends towards flat, uncolored accuracy (as does mine) and you don't want to spend loads of $, then the MDR-V6 is the one.

I once worked in a stereo store  so I have more exposure to audio products than the average person simply because I have spent more hours doing &#34;A-B&#34; comparisons between different brands of equipment for customers.  I was the service manager, and I have since gotten an engineering degree and have worked in product design since then.  My ears are sensitive, so I am a critical listener.  I don't like to turn up the volume to dangerous levels, so I must have high quality reproduction from speakers and headphones, instead of the head-splitting volume levels required by many products to &#34;sound good&#34; to the listener.  These 'phones reproduce the most subtle tones in music I have ever heard from a headphone, perhaps excluding some extremely high end Sennheiser equipment which is not available for sale anyway.  Every brand has its own sound; if you like clean, pure audio, these headphones will not disappoint you.  The design originated in the 1990's I believe.  These headphones are used by many DJs and other professionals who must listen to audio for many hours each day.  The fact that many (perhaps even MOST; I don't have the stats to state that more firnly) audio professionals choose these 'phones over the many others, most at higher cost, that are available for them, says it all.  You won't get over-done boomy bass, or screeching highs, or mid-range holes.  You will get smooth, accurate, very satisfying and clear sound.  Don't get me wrong-the bass response is outstanding; it just isn't distorted or boosted so the bass overloads your hearing and blocks other sounds.  Mid-range and highs are also outstanding, clear and comfortable.  Many other brands, regardless of price, either don't faithfully reproduce some part of the sound spectrum, or over-emphasize some part of it.To end the long-winded praise I've been writing so far, let me just say that you really won't be disappointed with these headphones if you want exceptional quality of workmanship and design and faithful reproduction of your audio and music.  Again, if you want some part of the sound spectrum to blast louder than the rest of it, these won't please you, but I don't know many people who have purchased other 'phones to get &#34;more bass&#34; or for some other reason, who have kept using what they bought.  They keep looking at other 'phones because the over-emphasized ones are hard on their ears and can actually give headaches and have other bad effects due to their modified response.These Sony headphones have been around for a long time and are still very popular with professionals and amateurs like me because of their clarity and comfortable reproduction of music and other audio.  I can listen for hours with these on and even forget that I have them on!  My wife teases me because I often stand up to go take care of something, and don't realize I have the headphones on until the cord pulls my head sideways and reminds me to take them off!  I am not making this stuff up, honestly, and I don't work for Sony!  I recommend these headphones to anyone who asks me what they should buy, because I want them to be happy with their purchase, and not come back at me with &#34;you gave me bad advice&#34;.I should mention that the cushions/pads which make these so comfortable for me are not very durable; they seem to separate at the seams and expose the padding inside.  Perhaps that is a side-effect of the very soft material they use for the pads?  In any event, I have read that the replacement pads available here are excellent and solve this problem nicely, without ruining the sound or comfort.  You can buy replacements from Sony for about as much as the after-market pads sold here byBeyerdynamic, but they will eventually fail just as the originals do.  The after-market pads seem to be most popular among the other reviewers here, so I will try them soon.  They use a different material which seems to be very comfortable, according to other reviewers here, instead of the artificial &#34;leather&#34; type material use by Sony, which is very comfortable, but won't last more than a year or two, and you will probably own these 'phones for many years.You will be thrilled if you choose these headphones.  You won't have any regrets, and you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars for a superb set of headphones.

Then they started to fall apart, so I decided to get a nice pair of headphones that would provide some isolation so my mom would stop yelling at me for listening to my music too loud. I spent hours online doing research on amazon and various audiophile websites. I was on the verge of buying the Sennheiser HD 280 until I saw this review comparing it with the V6: [...]I decided to buy the V6s, which were a little cheaper, lighter, smaller, more portable, and evidently better for rock music. After about a month they have not let me down, and now my mom yells at me for listening on my headphones too OFTEN. Soundwise there is no comparison to the earbuds most people use - the V6s are miles better. In the car, they sufficiently block out whatever is playing on the stereo, and my fellow passengers can't hear what I'm listening too. They also work well at night - I listen to them lying down in bed and my brother/roommate is not bothered. The bass is good enough for me, and everything sounds crisp and clear. Older classic rock recordings like Live Cream and Led Zeppelin sound especially amazing - it's fun actually being able to pick out the different instruments and ANALYZE a song, not just listen to it. Really cool...Negatives? Well, the coiled cord has already started to get messed up at the ends, and it's kind of thick and cumbersome. One of the earpads fell off and it was a pain getting it back on. They are not quite portable enough to wear while walking around the house, doing dishes, brushing your teeth, etc....I mean they work but it's kind of annoying. I will probably buy another more portable pair like the Sennheiser px100...Overall, a very good buy. They are comfortable and seem very durable. The carrying case is a nice touch, and they fold up really well (my nano also fits in the case!) They will be great for travel. I never used to listen to albums in their entirety...but now even the \"OK\" and \"mediocre\" songs are worth listening to just because of these headphones.

At first, when I first tried it, it sounded weird on my film soundtracks because I wasn't used to it, but after getting used to it I wondered what the heck I had been listening to with my last headphones. These new headphones make songs from a month ago sound too good!Third, the the ease of use is flawless, except sometimes when you take them off and put them back on, you might have to spread the earcups out as they like to be together.Fourthly is the comfort. I was thinking of giving this a four star, but decided not to. The reason why, was because the COIL. Yes the coil. That long cord. If you late it hang down next to your chair, it sometimes causes to send a beat back to your headphones. Not a sound, but you feel it, and it's annoying-- so I try to keep my wire on top of the desk. I might coil it up later when I feel like it. Other than that, it's perfect, except it does kind of block out sound so, if someone is calling you, forget it >.&lt; lolEDIT after over a year of use:The sound quality is great! Sometimes the wire can get in the way because of its weight, but if you keep it on the desk, which is really easy to do, there is no problem. The earpads are comfortable too. But there is a problem with this device. Despite its pros, the earpads aren't very strong, and replacements are even worse, AND harder to put on. The earpads that came with the device lasted 6 months. This is good. However, replacement pads I bought didn't last long at all, 1-3 months usually (one or both earpads). I've had to buy like 6 replacement pads. I admit, I might not be putting them on EXACTLY right, which I intend to take every precaution when buying a deluxe version pair, but still, the internal gradual ripping of the material covering the inner foam just keeps happening.

I've just ordered my third, only because I keep giving them away to people that I care about.  I care enough that I want them to hear music closer as they were meant to be heard.  I own Grados, high end Denons, and tried all the popular Senns, AKGs, etc.  It's a very personal choice, headphones.  I like the Grados for their sound: articulation, detail, staging... comfort wise, not so much.  The cord twists at the Y, and above the Y.  The foam is somewhat fragile if you're not careful.  Other than that, the Grados are spectacular - I just prefer them to any others that I've heard before including the $300+ Sennns.  But I'm not writing a review about the Grados.The Sony V6 are comfortable, with a closed design.  They're also more compact, better for travel.  If you're going to own one pair of headphones, these would be it.  I own several others, but I've ordered another pair of the V6.  Why?  Comfort.  Ease of use. Great sound, more on that in a minute.  The cord is much more manageable, the foam is comfortable, and the pressure is just right.  These are ideal for the computer, and efficient enough to listen to a verity types of music powered by my portable MP3 player.Sound: It's almost up there with the Grado 60, and better in some ways.  While it lacks the detail and articulation for classical music and jazz in comparison, the staging is fuller when listening to pop or dance.  I've stopped using my $179 DJ style Denons all together.  I use my Shure in-ears for working out.  Plan to use the V6 for travel, PC and just general purpose.  I'll still use the Grados (I've given many of these away as gifts too) time to time for classical and jazz.  And I was ready to plop down some money on some Senn 595s due to all the positive reviews... surprisingly, when I tried them out I preferred the sound of the V6 and Grado 60/80s at less than half the cost.  I'm sure many will disagree, but it just sounded flat in comparison.  The lesson learned?  Go try them before you go on faith of other's reviews for something like $200+ headphones.  On the V6, for $65 - I don't think there's a better buy, and chances are, you'll be happy with the way these sound.  Then again, it's just another review, but a favorable one.  In any case, I wish you good hunting.  On a related and different note: Home speakers, before buying the typical name-brands from the big box stores, I'd suggest trying Andrew Jones designed Pioneers (excellent for price) and the Epos line before you buy anything.  Both excellent buys, different price segments but both are worth auditioning.  Take a CD, and listen to them before making an impulse buy on anything else.  I share, because I ended up selling my brand-XXX after listening to them.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid choice.", "unixReviewTime": 1258416000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2009"}

If your music is a poorly recorded track, it will sound poorly recorded so I recommend feeding these \"studio monitor headphones\" the highest quality sound files you can. The bass can extend deep and low yet remain tight (not flabby), the mids are well balanced and have no artificial coloration to them, and the highs are all there. I auditioned these at a store before I bought them, and preferred them to the Audio Technica M-50's, Grado SR60's, Sennheiser 280's, and even some amped Sennheiser HD650's. And these Sony V6's don't need amping at all because can be easily driven by an ipod and get get really loud.I don't think these have a perfectly flat response, they are a little bass and treble heavy to my ears. I believe everyone's ears are different, and for me, I agree with the reviewers that say the treble can be harsh. And because of this, I could not crank the volume without the treble eventually becoming fatiguing. But since I still loved the sound and clarity of these, I tried to see if I could change this. I went to the craft store and bought some thin felt for a few cents, cut it to proper size and then placed it between the headphone drivers(speakers)and the ear pads. This cut down the harshness without changing anything else, and now I decided I will be keeping these.Another modification I had to do relates to my ears. My ears are big and poke out, and these headphones were very uncomfortable because they pushed on my ears to much, since they do have some clamping force for sound isolation. I found another simple solution for this: you cut some thin strips of cloth from a t-shirt and push them in the crevice under the pad that goes around your ears to give more space between your ear and the drivers, thus making them rest around your ears up against your head, and not ON your ears. You don't want to shove too much material in there or you start to lose some bass and could maybe tear the ear pads if you get too crazy. Just a half of an inch width by six inches long folded in half \"hot dog style\" worked great for me. I found I didn't need to upgrade to the Beyerdynamic pads after doing this, and now these are comfortable for hours and this saved me twenty four dollars. Since the headband has a metal spine through it, I was also successful in carefully bending it outward to provide less clamping force on my larger than normal head.The sound isolation on these is great, and I actually love the coiled cord which helps from keeping the cord ripped out of the headphone if it gets snagged on something. They are built very well, but I do not like the small wires exposed on the sides which I think makes them vulnerable to snag so I will have to be careful. I think these headphones are as good as you can get for $70, if you want better you are going to have to start spending a lot more money. Just make sure you buy from a refutable seller and make sure you don't buy fakes, which are out there in abundance. These headphones are great so I wrote this review- to let you know there potential and to show you how you can improve them with simple, non permanent mods if you are inclined to try them. I hope Sony never stops making these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite headphones, after a few small modifications", "unixReviewTime": 1371081600, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2013"}

After about 15 years of use, the foam padding was a bit run down. After doing the exhaustive search for the best headphones, I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD580s (I also own Etymotic ER-4Ps). Comparing the HD580 to my MDR-V6s, I would say that the MDR-V6s are better for two reasons. 1. The MDR-V6s are more comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and 2. The MDR-V6s have a telephone-like cord, which is easier to deal with than the straight HD580 cord. The sound quality was very good on both headphones, and about equal. I ended up buying new foam pads for my 15-year-old MDR-V6s, which made them feel like brand new headphones. I also bought a second pair of MDR-V6s, and shelved the HD580s for now.Do not buy the MDR-600s by mistake. I have never used them, but I have read numerous reviews that state that the MDR-600s are inferior to the MDR-V6s. You can still buy the MDR-V6s, but they are harder to find. I bought mine at millionbuy because Amazon did not have them in stock. For some reason, the MDR-V6 product name at Amazon magically changed to MDR-600, even though it is an entirely different product.

I do have to mention that these headphones reproduce music perfectly, which also means less bass compared to other phones (Beats) that intentionally inflate bass (which in my opinion distorts music that doesn't need it).

Many of the customer reviews online (not Sony's description) mentioned how amazing they are at sound isolation--like not being able to hear someone speaking right in front of you, or hearing music while you play acoustic drums even.  I was shopping for headphones specifically for use with an electronic drum kit so that I hear all the drum sounds and music tracks over the thumps and stick hits on the pads.  The customer reviews were BS.  These phones have essentially no noise isolation at all.  If I crank up the music to the point of getting an immediate headache, sure, then I don't hear my stick hits on the pads or the base pedal movement, but that's not isolation.  That's just drowning out ambient sound, which any $10 pair of headphones can do.  My in-ear buds do better at noise isolation than these over-ear phones that cost 4x as much.  With my iPod or laptop playing through them, I can still hear my girlfriend talk or my phone ring with only minimal dampening of the outside sound.  Even with them blasting, I can still hear my stick hits on the high-hat pad and swing of my cheap kick pedal.  I don't want to have to damage my hearing just to hear all the elements of a track without the manual noise.The construction quality and sound production are great, but it doesn't meet my specific needs.  I didn't need a hi-fi set just for listening to music, so overall I regret going with this set at this price.Good points are cool-factor, quality build, great sound. One truth in the customer reviews is that you start to hear elements in songs that you never noticed before--even in your favorite records you've heard dozens of times.  Pretty comfortable too, but for drumming they get hot  & sweaty quickly.  One negative is the weight of the coiled cord.  Can't really prop it out of the way b/c the weight of it plus the coil pulls it back.  I'm glad it feels sturdy and well made, but the cord gets in the way while I'm drumming no matter how I try to position it going to the drum module.Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V6 sound monitor headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1316476800, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2011"}

All of them were in the $40~$90 range, but they don't come close to the sound quality of the MDR-V6.The bass is punchy but not overbearing and the treble is appropriately loud. Overall it gives a relaxing mellow sound. Perfect for those who listen to lots of ballads, pop/modern-pop, most rocks, and breakbeat style music.It's still great for other genres like rap and hip-hop but the bass may get slightly overpowered for those so you may have to mess with the equalizer in your music player to listen to them.The build quality is great as well as since the earcups and the band connecting them are sturdy and can take unprecedented abuse. I've read some other user reviews stating that they've use this headphone for 10+ years and it's still going strong.However, it's not a perfect headphone. The three (minor) downsides I've found are:-Headphone needs a little breaking-in as it was uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time for the first 4~5 days.-Not ideal for outside use because of the coiled cords. When coiled the cord is 2~2.5ft but when stretched it can go from 6~7ft.-I've read some reviews that the stock faux leather earpads will deteriorate in 3~4 years.

First off, this is a truly great pair of headphones in the $70-$120 range. They have a very flat frequency response which means the lows, mids and highs pretty much get equal billing.

Because they were made more for studio monitoring rather than casual listening, some might feel they are lacking at the low end, but I think they just represent the music more faithfully. If you need to adjust the bass up higher, then go for it. They can handle it, and much better than the MDR-V600's which produce boomy low quality bass. The low frequencies on these are much tighter and more defined. Middle frequencies on these are great as well. Little to no coloring, vocals come through great. Middle frequencies on the 600's are pretty awful. It's like someone turned the treble up to 11. I don't know how else to put it. The one criticism I have of these is the poor quality of the earpads. Not only do little black flakes of fake leather start to come off after moderate use, but they completely came apart at the inner seam on mine, exposing the foam inside.

I was satisfied but not thrilled the way that so many others have been. The V6's are legends but I didn't see what all the hype was about. I mean they sounded good for the price, but not to the degree I was anticipating. Bass is very good, treble is very sparkly and bright, but the mids are unacceptably recessed, and even at times sound hidden, or veiled. Treble was riddled with sibilance too, not good. Now, at home I typically listen to AD-700s which have incredible mid-range. Furthermore I understand that the V6's get better and better with burn-in. We shall see. At this point I was just meh about the V6's. Then I remembered what I really bought them for.I brought up some high-bitrate voice recordings that are stored on my PC. WOW. These cans have incredible detail. Very, very analytical. I auditioned almost everything in the low-end pro monitoring segment (i.e. Shure SRH440, ARK 8400, AT M40fs, etc. etc). For pure analytical work such as vocal tracking none come close except maybe the Shure's which are so bass shy that they are almost a non-consideration. So bottom line is if you are in the sub $100 segment for the same reasons as me then you want these. If you want JUST good phones for listening on a bus or in the library I'd get Audio Technica M40fs or M35 which are less power hungry, more comfy and have a slightly more engaging overall sound. But for a good multi-purpose headphone with no compromises in vocal detail and an impulse-buy price point these simply can't be beat, and after all these years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good for listening, amazing for tracking", "unixReviewTime": 1352592000, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2012"}
{"reviewerID": "A27L1LCXW07XZM", "asin": "B00001WRSJ", "reviewerName": "Michael", "helpful": [281, 287], "reviewText": "This is a review for non/ semi-audiophiles and casual music listeners looking for the best deal headphones in this price range.These are classic headphones. Studios have been using them for years and EVERYONE in the music/ producing industry immediately recognizes these babies. And if you look for it, you can find them everywhere too.BUT, what if you're just in the market for some good music headphones? You're not an audiophile per se, but you do enjoy good sound.Well first of all, you have to understand these are \"studio\" headphones and the sound is \"uncolored\" and \"flat\". Yes the eq is flat. A lot of manufacturers \"color\" their headphones with extra warmth or bass. If you've owned Skullcandies, their sound is heavily bass emphasized. Same thing Beats by Dr. Dre, a very warm sound. The MDR-V6's don't have any of this extra coloration. Their purpose is to playback the natural, original sound of the recording. And in that regard, for the price, these CANNOT be beat. They have pristine clarity. And you will definitely find things in your music you have never heard before. The whole sound spectrum (bass, mids, treble) is perfectly represented. In other words, the quality of the sound is phenomenal, for any genre of music.So if you want to hear your songs naturally as they were recorded, stop no further and click \"Buy Now\".But what if you're more into bass-rich headphones, like Skullcandy. Or what if you were impressed with Beats by Dr. Dre or the Bose at the Best Buy sample booth. Those are warm headphones, and if you were expecting to find something similar to those at a fraction of the cost, these may not be for you. Sure the quality of sound of these Sony's is infinitely better than the Beats or Bose sets. But it is definitely not the same \"type\" of sound. The sound curves are completely different. Like I said before, the MDR-v6 is flat while the Beats and Bose are warm/ bass heavy.But do not waste your money on the Beats or the Bose. The sound might be impressive, but it really is cheap bloated bass. The MDR-V6, while it doesn't have as much impact or quantity, the bass is much more clear and tight. The quality is a million dollars better. Still, if you were looking for that warm type of sound (for hip hop and those sorts of genres, although the MDR-V6 do fine in ALL genres, some hip hop/ rap fans might prefer a more colored sound) you can find even BETTER headphones for the same price as the Sony's.There are plenty on the market, but a quick look on the Amazon top sellers and I found these.Sony XB500: $49 Amazon-Wonderful alternative to the Beats or Bose sets. Phenomenal bass and mids. Treble is also very present. No muddy/ bloated/ leaky bass like the Beats, but even more in quantity and impact.JVC HARX700: $54 Amazon (little bit more bass than 900)JVC HARX900: $60 Amazon (900 has a better soundstage i.e. better gaming/ movie headphone)Panasonic RP-HTF600: $33 Amazon (super budget)In-Ear Buds:The Klipsch Image S4: $79 Amazon-Similar sound spectrum to the Beats/ Bose except with a much better quality of sound. No muddy/ bloated/ leaky bass, but just as much in terms of quantity and impact.Brainwavz M2: $54 Amazon (similar sound signature)Meelectronics M6: $15 (super-super budget, only downside is the fit may not be for some/ takes getting used to)Those are my recommendations. Although ALL in ear headphones break after a few months/ years, which is something to keep in mind. Headphones tend to last much longer. In terms of durability, the MDR-V6 lasts decades according to many accounts.So if you are looking for the best quality sound for under $100, the Sony MDR-V6 is and has always been the KING!But if you are looking for a bass-heavy thumping set(the MDR-V6 do thump, but maybe not as much as the Beats you heard at the Best Buy display), if that's the case you might want to look for a more warmer sounding model (XB500 is my first choice recommendation- for $15 dollars cheaper too on Amazon)=====Note: if this is your first foray into the hi-fi audio world and these are your first headphones, you must realize that studio headphones like these are unforgiving to the source. Unforgiving means they will playback any and every single sound/ static in the source file. If you've downloaded most songs legally through itunes, you should be fine for the most part. But if some of the mp3s in your collection have been downloaded illegally, you might find that they sound significantly worse than before. Why? Because it might be of really low quality. The static noise and any other imperfections will be made apparent.I recommend you look into lossless audio formats like FLAC files. If you are using iTunes with an iPod/ iPhone, ALAC is the format you should use. ALAC files are much bigger, but are much higher quality than mp3. There is an option in iTunes to rip CD's with ALAC instead of mp3. You will notice the difference. Either that or make sure your mp3's are 320kb/s.Some headphones require an amp to pump out the best sound. These headphones don't require much to be driven. It works fine in just my iPhone. It's unnecessary but it would always benefit. But a better DAC would greatly improve the sound of a portable device/ laptop. If you are in the market for one, I'd recommend the Fiio E7. It's a portable amp/DAC combo. The sound difference is very noticeable. And it has a bass-boost EQ which is very good (don't put it at maximum though, it starts to distort a tiny bit there). It actually produces that \"warmer\" colored sound I was talking about before. So this could be a solution if you don't mind spending another $89. But if you're willing to spend that much in total ~$150. The Audio Technica M50 might be a better deal? Well, that's a tough question. But my personal preference still goes to the MDR-V6.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Review for Casual Music Listeners", "unixReviewTime": 1321228800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2011"}

I listen to many different genres of music, and different kinds of audio. Music wise, they belt out everything from Dubstep, to Classic rock, to metal, to 80's. All of which sound stunning, assuming the quality of the file is high enough. Listening to uncompressed classical music, or anything uncompressed is a dream. Anybody who watches ASMR videos would really appreciate these, crazy clarity and definition. Movies sound just as good on these bad boys. Games? No problem, everything from FPS, to racing, to RPG, to RTS all sound great... Really immerses you. Binaural audio is plain insane with these. Like I mentioned earlier, I wear these for many hours each day, and it is rare that they begin to make my ears sore, but when they do, i just adjust the position of them on my head a little or take a break from them. But overall comfort is great. I expect these to last many many many years as I treat them like a piece of china. I read lots of reviews of these before getting them that people have had them for upwards of 15 years. I want to buy 5 more pairs to cover me for life, they are just that great. I have yet to hear ANYTHING that compares. Then again I have yet to listen to really expensive audiophile cans, by like high end sennheisers, beyerdynamics, Audeze, AKG, or HiFiMAN. But when in comparison to anything sold by a brick and mortar retailer (as well as apple store) this kills everything. I never want to part with these.My apologies for the lack of direction or organization with my review, but it is late and I wanted to get my thoughts of it online for other people to see. Oh, and I have had these for 3-4 years, can't remember, and they are in as good of shape as when I got them", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Just a fantastic set of cans", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

The sub-bass is wonderfully overstated and vocals come through crystal clear. The soundstage isn't particularly large, but wide soundstages are elusive in headphones under $300.

I can wear these guys for hours on end and only thing I can complain about is not hearing other people, which isn't such a bad thing when one is trying to focus. A pro and con for these would have to be the chord though, I have forgot I was wearing these and have gotten up and walked across my room and back only to realize they were still on my head, which isn't bad but the chord is the old fashioned loose coil so it dangles. These are great for any kind of music, whatever genre you think of they work for. These things are big though, and with a long chord it makes it a odd walking around with them, they aren't jogging headphones, place to place is fine i do it, just tuck the chord somewhere so you don't step on it.

That is a shame because they are definately the best sounding headphones that I have ever owned (and I have owned many).  I have always been in the habbit of purchasing high-end headphones, which are usually heavy, very large, and typically make your ears uncomfortably hot after extended use.  After reading rave reviews for the Sony MDR-V6, over the past several years, I finally decided to give them a try for myself. After hearing that they were being discontinued I was afraid that I would not be able to find them anymore.  I was extremely happy to find them right here on [...], and for a GREAT price.Some of the primary reasons for my decision to purchase this model include the high sensitivity level (106dB/mW), the large 40mm drivers and the impressive 5-30,000 Hz frequency response.  The high sensitivity allows these headphones to be used with low powered devices, such as my iPod Touch.  Although these headphones sound best when plugged into a home stereo receiver, they still sound stunning when plugged into a portable MP3 player.  So if you desire a quality set of headphones, which can be used with virtually any audio device you may own, the Sony V6s are the perfect choice.  Deep bass, smooth and natural midrange, and crisp (yet not piercing), clean treble, these cans produce the widest frequency range that anyone could expect from headphones costing three times as much.  The V6s may not be perfect for those wanting bass enhancement.  The bass is definately deep with these phones but it is tight, rather than boomy and muddy sounding.These headphones are light (rated 230 g - which is about 1/2 lb) and comfortable to wear for hours at a time.  The clean, uncolored sound will make you soon prefer to listen to all of your music through these headphones rather than through full-sized speakers.  They do a pretty good job of blocking outside noise without entirely preventing you from hearing the phone ring (if you have the ringer set loud enough), the children calling you, or even hearing the doorbell ring.  The build quality is very good and I am expecting these phones to last me for many years to come.  They even come with a nice \"pleather\" case to hold them in when not in use.  The phones fold up nicely and fit in the case perfectly.  The 10 ft. coiled cord is rugged and well shielded, and there is an included adapter to convert the 3.5mm mini-plug to a full-sized 1/4\" plug.  I would highly recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones to anyone who is serious about listening to quality audio.

When listening to the artist voice it's so clear and rich. And yes you will hear parts of the song that you have  never heard before. As comparing them to others...stop it's not worth the time or the money. I heard the dr. Dre beats headphones which are 199.99 and they didn't have the same clarity as the sony's. They beats are more bass heavy and trust me I'm a bass head but quality bass  head. Don't get me wrong these sony's are not short stopping by no means.Let me tell you about the quality really quickly, the line cord is very nice med grade duty like. But hey they are 70 bucks. I am so glad I didn't buy the beats, thanks to my bro marlin for saving me and my wallet. A lot of people have said that the ear pads are like a tissues material.. Their right on the money there but not horrible. Um what else oh the comfort feel is fine to me and I have a larger head with glasses and no issues and matter of fact they feel like their not even there. the overall construction is nice, good weight but not heavy, plus these aren't flashy just nice and simple but not boring. But I will say the plug in is a little on the low side for quality but again it's 70 bucks. I figure if u aren't hard on your stuff they will last forever. The volume is fine great levels with out losing integrity. It comes with a black carrying case and a larger adapter for amps, I would purchase a better carrying case like someone else stated.Last thing im plugged into a iPad listening to pandora as I write this and the power hasn't diminished.

I read from previous reviews that these can be worn for a long time but i didnt find that to be the case (compared to the XD400's). Because of the minimalist circumaural design I wouldnt recommend this for folks with larger than normal ears2. High impedance and hence not the best for mp3 players.

I considered the 7506 but I usually take good care of my electronics so I didn't want to pay the extra $15 for it.  Anyway, I just want to write a review as there are some questions that I wished were answered before purchasing. Before I start, I want to let people know that this is my first over the ear headphone.  I always use earbuds due to it portability.  I run with them so the V6 isn't ideal in that situation. Okay, now the review.The product:It is very well made, no cheap plastic parts.  The wires are long and good for sitting in one place to listen to your music, esp from a receiver.  If you have to walk around while holding your portable music player like my zune hd, then it can be a handful to hold bc you will need to carry the cord around along with your music player.  Not a big deal, but just a heads up if you are looking for something a little more portable and manageable.  I have been using this for a couple of days now and the earpieces hurt my ears after an hour of use.  People said it will get better.  I only hope so, but I bought a Beyerdynamic replacement because I heard it is more comfortable and that it will make the music even better too.  I also heard the original earpiece won't last very long.  My other complaint of the original earpiece, like others have stated, is that my ears get warm after 15 minutes of use and becomes sweaty.The music:I have used $30 sony earbuds and $60 klispch earbuds before and I have to say that this definitely sounds better.  The lows are deep, the mids are excellent, and the highs are very clear.  The biggest difference between this and my other earbuds is the clarity of the music, especially the vocal. I don't know if the earbud's small single driver or its proximity from inside the ear canal that is causing the sound to be muddy, but this over the ear headphones make the music sound more natural and clear.  I used to love a lot of bass in my music and I still do as I listen to Trance often. If you are looking for a headphone with booming overpowering bass, then this might not be for you.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the loudness of the bass when I first listened to Tiesto or Hip Hop music.  I am not saying that the bass isn't good, it is very good, very deep.  It's just not eardrum breaking. =P. For alternative, pop, and other music that emphasize vocals and a dynamic range of bass and treble, this headphone performs brilliantly.  You can hear all the different instrument being played very clearly. It actually made me fall in love with the vocal of one of my favorite female singer. ^_^ If your MP3 conversion isn't great, then you can hear all the crackles and static. I don't know if that is a good thing or bad.  One thing I noticed is that I needed to turn up the volume a little more compared to my earbuds to hear the music on the same loudness level.  I think perhaps portable music player like my zune HD requires a bit more power for the headphone compared to earbuds.  I usually listen to my zune HD at level of 18-20, but with the V6, I listen between 20-23. I love music and this headphone has taught me to appreciate it even more.  I have learned to love the quality of the music now, and not just the loudness of the bass.  As for noise cancellation, it does reduce outside noise by about 33% IMO but there is no noise cancellation, passive or active. You can hear outside noise without music turned on.Update after a month of use:Music still sounds great.  Only problem I have is that the earpiece is so uncomfortable.  They press against my ears and hurt a lot after an hour of use.  It also gets very sweaty too.

I was hoping this one will sound as great as many had said.  After 60 hours of burn-in, I started my evaluation using reference music and test CDs.  This headphone is by no means neutral as very well recorded piano music sounded rather compressed and digital even on my Marantz SA-13S1.  Highs lack texture and are on the thin side and sounded as if treble has been set to maximum.  In classical music musicians are heard taking a deep breath  while playing.  This sounded thin artificial and like I describe before, the treble was boosted to full setting.  Bass is maintained in the middle making the headphone sound boomy. Overall sound is bright and equalized.  On jazz CDs, the same was observed.  It does however have drive clarity and ability to reveal difference between sources.This headphone is suited for DJs and iPods.  If I was an audio recording engineer, I will certainly be looking for an accurate sound.***********************After 15 more hours of use, high-frequencies are getting better with improved texture.  I went shopping for an audiophile headphone, and I can say that the MDR-V6 has better build-quality than many more expensive phones.  I can't give it more star, but it is worthy of 4 stars.If this set improves, I will provide more feedbacks.************************************************his is my third feedback of the Sony MDR-V6 now that it has fully broken-in with many more hours over the initial 75 hours when I first made my review. High-frequencies have become bigger more detailed revealing more texture, while sound stage is bigger yielding more depth. Though not as wide as my first set. Bass, attack and speed remain the same. On a very well recored Jazz from ECM label, the texture of the drums is captured very well.I am very happy with this headphone although it is a bit tight on the ears, but I don't spend long hours listening to music via headphones.

I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).

Think slippers for your ears. You can almost forget you are wearing them. The second is the total lack of the enclosed sound most headphones have to some degree. This means you can also forget that you are listening through headphones. The third is their startling clarity. You don't have to strain to make out sounds. The overall effect is that the designers of the MDR V6s have effectively removed the headphones from the listening experience. This in itself is a phenomenal achievement. You should have these headphones if only to experience this level of performance.But are they sonically perfect? Well no, not really. The low bass can sometimes sound a bit punchy and thereby be a distraction. The soundstage often does not extend much beyond your head. They are not euphonic headphones  which will mask poor material with a big midbass hump  (this is a good thing, actually). And they sometimes seem a little thin in the lower midrange so that voices might not sound as rich as you might like. But given the way these phones present the sound, they  need make no apologies.

They will be replacing it with the same 7506 model.. Unlike for the MDR-V6 if it was found defective by Sony they will just replace it with a consumer headphones MDR-V600.. The price difference is $30 which is a lot.. thats why I chose MDR-V6 instead.. Some say that MDR-V6 sounds more neutral and uncolored than the 7506.

I haven't compared these head-to-head like many people, but I have used many headphones over my life.I have never hear any set of headphones deliver such smooth, silky, sound.  Yet, when I listen to the climatic end of \"Comfortably Numb\" on Pink Floyd's Pulse CD you can hear every note with exactness, and then each pluck of the bass and shimmering cymbal clash of \"TBD\" on Live's Throwing Copper CD, which seems like zero distortion to my consumer-level ear.To go along with this, I switch to audiobooks, and you get something extraordinary.  You can latch on and almost see the waveform in your head while enjoying the clarity of a narrator's tone, enunciation, and inflections, adding yet another dimension to the storytelling.Classical music, I think you could only top it by being in the concert hall, harp is wonderful, cello flows like a river, and you can dam near hear the pianist moving his hand to the next key.  It is just gorgeous!  Just close your eyes, and enjoy it.They fit well, and don't bug me at all.

My computer sits on top of my desk and I can roll around my entire office while listening to music and roll right back up to my computer and the cord will follow suit and coil itself up nicely -- always away from the ground and never unplugging or becoming an unpleasant tension on the headphones.One very slight, minimal unpleasantry is that at very low volumes the bass seems to outweigh the other tonal ranges.  This might be due to my ear's over-sensitivity to bass from a previously \"bass-weak\" set of headphones.All in all, these headphones are a delight to wear, feel very sturdy and yet comfortable, produce great sound and tonal accuracy at all volume levels, and don't seem to have any distortion.Despite the volume inside the headphones, very little noise pollution is noticed by neighbors.  At moderate levels nothing is heard even two feet away.All music genres appear to come through loud and clear even at soft volumes.Disclaimer: I am not an audiophile -- just someone who appreciates music that seems true to its original form.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing set of headphones", "unixReviewTime": 1286236800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2010"}

My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because these V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered, and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of \"over-the-ear\" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensiveKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphonesfor occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first \"quality\" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have observed:- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone \"for Digital\", and the 7506 has blue stickers \"Professional\". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: \"both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number.\"- The box for the 7506 states \"neodimium magnet\". The operating instructions included with the V6 state \"samarium cobalt magnet\". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:- MDR-7506:- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity- MDR-V6:- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivityI am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And the two headphones do have slightly different sound.Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The \"professional\" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.I've been using these headphones with theAudioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair ofBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushionsfor this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb Headphones and Excellent Value (with comparison to Sony MDR-7506)", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}

That reason will become apparent to anyone who has the pleasure of putting these headphones on their head. Granted, they are not the highest end, but they are the best value within a price range that extends well higher than what these headphones are selling for. They sound amazing. I can only describe the overall sound as balanced; reference if you will. Highs are crisp, mids are balanced, low end is solid.I used to own a set ofSennheiser HD-280 PRO's. I parted ways with them when I bought a set ofSennheiser  HD595's. The 595's are exceptional headphones in all applications, but I did miss the extra punch and isolation that the HD-280's offered, especially with electronic based music. A friend of mine recommended these MDR-V6's for me to try instead of purchasing another set of HD-280's. I've very glad that I followed his recommendation and purchased a set of these.I have been using these headphones for 3 months. I typically use them with a CMoy headphone amp plugged directly into aSound Blaster X-Fi Titanium. I've also used them with my laptop and Android phone just fine without amplification. As with all headphones, there was a little bit of a break-in period before they settled into where they are now. Unlike some of the other headphones and earphones I've used, these didn't change drastically over their burn-in. That isn't really a problem as far as I'm concerned though. These sounded well balanced out of the box. The changes as they were used was more of a subtle rounding out of the sound.As for how they feel, they're pretty comfortable. I have a decent sized head and fairly large ears. The pads on these *just* cover my ears. If my ears were any bigger, then I don't think the seal would be correct. This would only be an issue for a smaller number of people with really large ears. They are not overly tight, but do have enough tension to create a good seal. With my Sennheiser's HD-280's, it felt like my head was in a vice. My ears would get really warm and I'd end up with a sweat ring where the pads sit, even after they'd loosened up with a year of use.The build quality on these is solid. Plastic isn't the main material used for these. I have read about the ear pads flaking off after years of use, butreplacementscan be had fairly inexpensively, andupgradesare only a little bit more.If you're considering these headphones and looking at its rivals, don't hesitate. They are worth far more than what they are priced and are easily the best value for a studio quality headphone in this price range. More often than not, I'm using these MDR-V6's over my Sennheiser 595's. I will not part with them.Also, save yourself a few dollars.

It's to be expected, and it's not too tremendously distracting or annoying.The only (small) gripe I have about these headphones is that the adjustable band is pretty loose.  I'll set them on the third click out from the base - the perfect length to fit my head - and sometimes if I take them off or set them down or even fidget too much while wearing them, they'll slide looser or push tighter really easily.  The catch mechanism that holds the adjustable bands in place needs to be a bit tighter.  They fit just fine most of the time, though, and I love them enough to ignore a small design flaw like that.I look forward to wearing out many sets of earpads on these headphones, and then buying another set when they finally give up the ghost.  Many of the reviews I've read say that people have owned the same pair for ten years or more, so I look forward to many years of listening pleasure with these fantastic Sony MDR-V6's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Totally Awesome Sound Experience", "unixReviewTime": 1284508800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2010"}

I do not fall into the \"audiophile\" category though.I remember auditioning these in a store about 6 years ago with Sennheiser hd 497 and at the time I had the impression that the Sony MDR V6 didn't have enough definition in the high end, plus they were more expensive and went with the Sennheisers.I always struggled with the long and very puny cord that came with the Sennheisers, and though they seemed comfy at first, I would get serious fatigue on longer sessions. Eventually the cord shorted out on me for some reason. While considering another pair, I remembered the V6, surprised to see it still existed and after reading all the positive reviews I ordered them.These headphones are a pleasure to use. Excellent and balanced sound, throughout the dynamic range. I feel I can really get deeper into the music. The moment you wear them, its like your head is in a pillow, its so comfortable. The weightiness and closed nature of phones blocks out some outside sound, and helps put you in a \"listening mode.\" I actually prefer these on flights to some of the noise-canceling headphones I've used before. I love the the way the cord coils up and stretches when needed, as well as the fact that it has a very solid construction. Lastly, the pair folds up to a compact size, great for traveling. I'm sure some might think that these are secondary to the sound quality, which is true, but it has a large effect on how much you end up using it as your go-to pair of headphones.Also, I would mention that most studios that I have done recording sessions in have at least a few of these for the musicians' headphone mixes. The fact that they are known to not \"color\" the sound has also helped me as a musician, mixing some of my smaller projects at home using these very headphones -- with quality results.I've read that it is easy to swap out the pads, which is a plus for longevity.I'm sure the other reviewers would have pointed out things I might have missed.Lastly, I would like to say that somehow the sound seems to have improved over time, the more I use them. Not sure if it is the \"break-in\" phenomenon that some mention, or just me getting more used to them. Either way, it has been a positive experience.I was happy with the purchase, and hope you enjoy these if you decide to purchase them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent sound, reliable, solid and comfortable.", "unixReviewTime": 1233792000, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2009"}

My review will start off with the listening experience, and then I will go with recording applications.As a person who just likes listening to music ranging from mellow R&B; to upbeat trance, the melodies come out very detailed and a person is able to tell that the mix is transparent.  This probably won't suit people who listen to rap or hip-hop music if they are looking for enriched bass in their music, but even without settings you can still hear that the bass is punchy enough.  However, look no further if you like hearing music at its full detail determining what the mix engineers have done to fatten or thin out parts of the sound.  As others reviewers mentioned, nothing is colored, which I do prefer as I see things from the engineering perspective.  And yes, a product that has started almost 30 years ago is still going strong; therefore, I can't recommend this product enough for those who appreciate music the way it's designed to be.Now as for recording applications, I can understand why studios recommend the MDR-V6 as their standards.  I have always contemplated on owning stereo monitors (AKG, M-Audio, and the like), but I did not have the space for that and didn't want to go over $200 just to get a pair of good and long-lasting monitors.  As I have done my research, I was happy to find that this pair is the best bang for buck; after seeing the Sony store about 60 miles away from where I live carrying the product for $88 plus tax, I knew that Amazon had the best deal and therefore grabbed a pair from them.  I have just done and completed a mix, then master, of a track, making it as transparent as possible for all speakers, and am very impressed with the results since I was able to adjust the fatness or thinness of sound without exaggerations; what you see/hear is what you get.  Therefore, for those who like to do home recording, I highly recommend this product as it will help you get the best transparent sound that you are looking for.With all of that said, I hope this review gives an idea for those thinking about purchasing this product.

Sony V6 was designed for me!I was looking for a high quality all-around headphone, with a special interest to use it in a kind of noisy setting.

Price was a big consideration and at $72.00+ and having very good service with the MDR-v600 this became a logical choice.I've only used the headphones for about 6 hours and I'm very pleased with them.  Some reviews mentioned a weak base and I agree, but tweaking the EQ corrects that well enough for light jazz and rock-a-billy (I go back to early days).  However I've found that listening to classical, especially Baroque, the MDR-V6's shine. Unlike others, I don't have a problem with the treble.  I've found it to be very clean, for lack of a better word.  One thing I did find out very quickly is I have to knock the volume down another 8-10 Db.  These headphones are very loud.As far as comfort goes, well Sony missed the boat.  I don't find them to tight but the headband is lacking padding. If you have hair on top it may not be a problem, I don't.  The MDR-V600 had excellent padding and I salvaged that padding and attached it to the MDR-V6 with a bit of Scotch tape.  Looks weird but they at least they are comfortable now.I did knock off a star for the comfort level but the rating is 4.5.

So I went to the store to get a new pair and found no MDR 7506's anywhere availabe but I kept seeing the MDR V6's everywhere. They looked identical to my old MDR 7506's and so I looked up and compared technical specs and guees what? They were pretty much the same headphones except that my old MDR 7506's had a gold plated plug and were $20 more expensive. I was hesitant to buy them because even though I didn't mind paying $20 less I wondered if this meant the quality was also less.  Oh no not the case at all! In fact, I think that the MDR V6 sounds identical BUT with a little better bass. My brother has a more recent pair of MDR 7506's and we did blind tests to compare and had a hard time telling wich model was which. He himself even said he would have invested in a pair of MDR V6's knowing what he knows now to save $20. He also noticed that my new MRD V6's seemed to reproduced slightly better bass.

I've been using a pair of on-the-ear Sony MDR-84's with a frequency response of 10Hz to 24,000Hz that I got for $50 in the 1990's. The V6's are clearly better. Deeper and richer bass, significantly better clarity. The sound is precise and delicate. I can understand lyrics better with these phones. My Yamaha P-70 electric piano sounds much nicer too. It has excellent samples and I can hear a significant difference with the V6's compared to the 84's. Do note however, you need a quality source to hear this difference. Most portable MP3 players don't even take full advantage of my MDR-84's. I'm listening to my MSI 760GM-P35 motherboard with a Via chipset, a quality portable CD player, and my Yamaha piano.Some people scoff at the idea of headphones with a response to 30,000 hertz since most humans can't hear above 16,000 Hz. What they don't understand is that while the typical adult human can't hear a pure tone above 16kHz, headphones or speakers that can produce a 30kHz tone will sound more clear and precise at frequencies lower than 16kHz which we can hear. We can't hear the pure tone but we can hear sharp changes in lower frequencies, sharp changes that can only be produced by a speaker capable of 30kHz.Around-the-ear headphones are superior in two ways: (1) By putting pressure on the side of the head rather than the ear lobe they are far more comfortable, especially if you wear glasses. I can wear these for hours with no discomfort. And (2) they make a better seal around the ear which allows better bass.My only criticism is that there should be a label or at least a mention in the manual saying that the headphones may need a few hours of loud music to wear in, and until they do, one side or the other may have lower volume. At first I worried they were defective because the left side was significantly quieter. I imagine that many people have returned them as defective because of this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Precise and Delicate Clarity", "unixReviewTime": 1365638400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2013"}

Sennheiser customer service said they would soften with use but for $1500 for the HD 800s, I was not willing to chance it and returned them.Next came the Sennheiser IE 800 IEMs, again with excellent sound.

Bass through treble sound vivid, balanced.- Solid construction. Metal headband, many screws- Comfortable to wear.- Flexible \"telephone\" cord is a plus.- Came with large stereo jack adaptor.- Folds compactly in (faux?) leather draw-string bag.Cons:- My old phones had a manual slide volume adjustment on the cord, the Sony doesn't.- The headband musses up my hair.I'm quite satisfied with these headpones for their sensitive, expressive, accurate, efficient sound reproduction.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excites my ears", "unixReviewTime": 1171497600, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2007"}

Turner\"", "helpful": [3, 18], "reviewText": "Reading these reviews you'd think you were ordering a key to salvation.I've had these headphones for about 4 years now and bought them originally because, probably like you, I saw great reviews, saw that they were an industry standard, and figured \"You get what you pay for.\" Unfortunately, this is one of those times popularity and hype are misleading and disappointing. How can this be?, you say. How can so many people be wrong?, you ask. Well, you know a lot of people don't care if they listen to crap music. Just like a lot of people don't care what they put into their mouths and call food. Maybe I just got a flawed pair, but when I tested models in stores, it's the same story.They are bulky with the appearance of being serious and having a lot of material in them, so you'd think that they'd be pretty sturdy and comfortable. Not true. they light, flimsy and bulky. You get a giant pouch to keep them in, but it's a hassle to get them in the pouch and if you put them in your bag, the spiral cord tangles, the collapsable earpieces sprawl out- it's a mess. I have a small head, so I keep them the tightest they can go so they'll be even with my ears hanging from the crown, but they're too loose around my head. Also, every 20 minutes I have to adjust them since there's no latch in place to keep the length I pull the earcuffs out to. And the worst thing about they're construction- the earpads constantly fall off. They're not glued on, they just kind of fit on like a shower cap so if you tug on them or they just stretch a little over time with use, they fall off and putting them back on is like fitting a tall kitchen garbage bag onto an outdoor 50 gallon bin. You've been there. Except smaller scale and with your fingernails.And last but most important, the sound quality sucks. It's awful. I don't know how so many people calling themselves avid music lovers can endorse them (but then I also don't understand popular music these days). The sound has zero depth. Zero. It's got a lot of bass and a very small actual sound range where I guess all of the frequencies are shuffled toward the middle so they're louder, but once you adjust the volume it's all just muddled and bland. I'm not a fan of all-the-bass you can get sound, I like a richer more tonally balanced sound for most of my tunes, and these headphones just don't cut it. When I first got them, I bought into the idea that \"they'll get better with use.\" They've definitely gotten worse with use. I remember waiting for the bus one day wearing these headphones (don't get caught in the rain with them) and thinking, \"Oh no, all my music is crap.\" then  I switched to my Apple earbuds. I prefer those free earbuds about 10x more than these headphones.On the other hand, I would prefer my less bulky pair of Grado headphones that look a lot less over-wrought, with a simpler design but a simply sublime, balanced sound.

So, unlike many other good headphones, these can be driven by an iPod without needing a headphone-amp.2.  Three other features that makes them especially good for iPods: (a) they come with a mini-plug, not the big phono plug that many headphones have, (b) they fold up and become small (for headphones, not for earbuds), and (c) they are CHEAP (so you don't feel it's too risky to carry them all over creation).3.  The ear pads fall apart after a few years, but that's really a blessing because you can then spend about $25 and get replacement cushions for the Beyer DT250 or DT280 that are much better.

They are highly durable; I'm not afraid to throw them around a little bit, or even stuff them into my backpack. The coiled cord can get heavy at times.

Some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets' response patterns, but it's hardly noticeable. The only real difference is that the 7506 has a gold-tipped jack whereas the V6 does not. One reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly (I.e. NOT installed in a studio setting) the gold plating could eventually wear off.

I can tell you that these headphones do sound great but for some reason require me to turn the volume really high to get sound out of them. This might just be how monitor headphones are though. But I wouldn't really know. Now on to the review. I plugged these into my Bose companion speakers and had to turn the volume more than halfway to get the normal amount of sound that I usually get from a regular pair of headphones. Now I know what you are thinking. This guy must be deaf if he has turn the volume that loud to hear something. But thats just not the case. Now I tried watching videos on youtube and listening to music on the computer and the volume was really low on them with volume turned up halfway on my Bose Companion Speakers. I also plugged these into to my Sony Walkman X Series to test the sound quality. I had to turn the volume all the way up to 19 to get surround sound. Now with the EX earbuds that came bundled with my walkman I only need to turn the volume up to 11 or 12 to get the same surround sound. Note that the volume limit on my walkman is only 30. So for me to have turn the volume up to 19 with the Sony MDR-V6 its already passed the AVS Limit which is the safe volume for listening to music. Like other reviews have stated before the headphones are extremely sensitive. This was especially noticeable to me when the volume on my walkman was 12 or below. The sound from the left and right side of the earpads would keep changing when I was walking around with it especially when the coil came in contact with something else. I was able to solve this problem though by turning the volume up to 19 on my walkman. The headphones them self are really light weight and comfortable to wear. The headphone cord itself is heavier than the pair of headphones. I would recommend these headphones if you were to just sit in one place and listen to them.

I figured I'd have to spend at least $150. But after doing a little research, these seemed like a great gamble at $70. I was most definitely not disappointed.Background: No, I did not sample a ton of comparable headphones. My research said it was this, or Audio Technica ATH-M50s I wanted (http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000P62ND6). I had seen enough favorable reviews of these to decide to save the $80 bucks and give them a try. While I didn't listen to a ton of comparable models (just being honest), I did listen to a friend's pair of Sennheiser open headphones, that retail for around $500, connected to an external amp and DAC, with FLAC audio. So, I think I at least sampled what the top end could be.While that was great, it was ultimately not what I was purchasing for. Open headphones sound amazing, but this purchase was for use at work, shutting out the rest of the world. On the positive side, I've ended up using them at home on weekends listening to music just for enjoyment. Additionally, I don't have a vast collection of lossless audio, or vinyl I listen to. Mostly spotify  at 320kbps, and stuff I have in iTunes.As far as music I listen to with them, it ranges from a ton of house/EDM, classical, and then everything in between. Largely those first two though, since I find lyrics distracting for getting work done.Anyway, the background info is just to let you know how I use them and what my expectations were, so if your requirements are different, you can take my review with a grain of salt.For listening to music from digital sources, without a separate amp, with the goal of closing out the world, these headphones sound fantastic, and at a great price. The performance per dollar is about as high as I can imagine you'll ever find, since the next step up is likely twice the price. Also, they do a great job of not letting sound out. I can be listening to music pretty much at an 11 on the loudness scale, and someone sitting next to me wouldn't know.Final thing, just be aware, these are NOT portables. The headphones themselves wouldn't be a huge issue, but the cord is long and heavy. This is a good thing, but not for walking around town or being on a subway, etc. For what it's worth, I recently purchased Apple's new earpods for that purpose for $30, and I'd also highly recommend those at the price point. Much more comfortable than the classic white Apple earbuds, and dramatically better sound.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing value", "unixReviewTime": 1354320000, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2012"}

Music sounds good, TV shows and movies sound GREAT, and video games sound completely 3-dimensional.

I stretched them out for a while (on the box they came in) and it reduced the pressure to a comfortable level, but they still want to meet together all the way.  Also, the hinges continually fold up when I don't want them to.  The coil cord makes itself dangle from my PC's headphone jack, so I have to weight it to the desk.  Sonically, my only complaint is that certain bass frequencies will distort if you boost them with an EQ.Other thoughts:  I tested these phones with a lot of albums that I know and love and continually noticed new things.  When my friend wanted to try them, I told him to put on something that he is familiar with.  As soon as he put them on he independently said the same thing, that he heard stuff he never heard before.I have not had any problems with the high impedance of these phones, even though I measured the DC resistance of mine at 74 ohms.

{"reviewerID": "AD73VMNYB8XVX", "asin": "B00001WRSJ", "reviewerName": "S. Lee \"spamination\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "The 3 things that all great headphones have in common are: Durability; Sound Quality; Comfort.1) DURABILITY:  This may very well be the most important factor of headphones.  By definition, headphones are meant to be portable.  Everyone at one time or another has thrown their headphones into a backpack or laptop case.  Headphones generally need to be replaced only when they break or get misplaced.  The MDR-V6 are just about the most durable things I've ever seen.  It's classic Sony construction.  Mostly made of metal and thick in the vulnerable parts, these are built to last.  In addition, they collapse to a nice compact shape further enhancing portability and durability.  The coiled cord is also designed to last.  Think telephone cord.  So unless you have a pet who insists on chewing things, the cord will never be the reason you replace these.  Finally, they come with a bag for even more durability.  If you are even considering the Bose Triports, slap yourself sober now.  I can snap the Triports with 2 fingers.2) SOUND QUALITY:  The Sony Digital Line of headphones have been the standard for audio clarity for decades.  So if you're jaded by past experiences with non-Digital Line of Sony headphones, don't be.  These are on par with the newer High-Definition line of Sony Headphones.  Digital sound by nature is tinny.  But these headphones give equal clarity and attention to the low and mid frequencies.  I often listen to classical music, and woodwinds, bass and percussions glisten through these headphones.  I also use these for Hip-Hop, Rock, Pop, Jazz and everything under the sun except country.  These headphones excel across all genres.  Now with the obligatory comparison to the Bose Triports.  With Bose Triports, I have to REALLY exert myself to isolate instruments and sounds.  The MDR-V6 isolate sounds for you.  You can just sit back and enjoy the show.  In addition, Bose Triports sound like your listening underwater when compared to the MDR-V6s.  Once again, 1/2 the price, more than 2x the performance.  MDR-V6s dominate this category.3) COMFORT: These are on-the-ear heaphones.  NOT around-the-ear.  These require careful placement on your ears.  For maximum comfort, place as much of the pad directly on the fattest parts of your earlobe.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but place them a bit forward on your ears.  If placed properly, these are as comfortable as any set of headphones I've ever owned.  I have a REALLY big head, and these headphones with a tight headband give me no problems on even 7 hour flights.  Like any on-the-ear headphones, you will need to move them around to discover what is most comfortable for you, but once you find your sweet spot, these are as comfortable as you will ever need.Forget bang-for-the-buck.  These are great headphones no matter what price range your consider.  Sennheuser, Audio-Technica, Bose, or whatever brand you are considering...stop right here and click \"Add to Cart\".

Delivery was prompt and hassle-free.First off, the headband seems to be tilted forward a bit, making it seem a bit uncomfortably close to the forehead, but this turns out to be an excellent feature - when going one-cup, this forward tilt really makes it more comfortable. I'd give it a 5/5 for overall comfort, that headband issue included with other factors like ear cup comfort and just the right amount  of cling.In terms of sound, this set of headphones sounds GREAT - especially for the type of music I spin (house/techno), it delivers deep punching bass while maintaining excellent clarity throughout the mid-to-high ranges.  I can't really vouch for the headphone's native EQ tendencies (I'm always adjusting the EQ of each track while mixing) but I can say that these headphones, aside from their clarity and enjoyability, are benefited by that invisibility - the old analogy of a well-polished window to \"see\" your music clearly comes to mind.In terms of durability, I haven't really seen any real wear/tear issues - the only main thing I've noticed is the coiled cable getting a little looser but that's not much of a complaint.These headphones come in an attractive red velvety display box with a nice faux-leather pouch to keep/transport them in.

The sound quality, workmanship, and look are all top-notch, unlike the Bose Tri-Ports, which are only able to boast sound quality - and the Bose phones go for twice the price.I'll give a quick run-down of the look of the phones for anyone who's wondering what exactly they look like [images are scarce on the net]. Each can has large, soft cushions that circle around the ear [circumaural] and form a relatively air-tight seal that blocks out surrounding noises quite well. The cans have two joints each that allow them to be folded, facing each other, up under the headband that connects them for easy storage. The joints closest to the headband are made of both metal and plastic, which gives the cans a solid feel when you retract them. The cord, which is about a meter long unextended, comes away from the left can only, so you don't have to worry about tangled cords. The right can's wire loops through the headband to the left can.Above each can is a two-pronged arm that can swivel a few degrees left and right to fit every head shape. And above those, there are flat metal extensions, just like most headphones have, to adjust for your ear height [11 notches on each side].The last version of the V6s that were made are the ones you can get now, and they still have a great late-80s/early-90s look. Each can has a red and gold bar with text that says \"for DIGITAL\", and \"Studio Monitor\" is displayed on the top of the headstrap in silver lettering.I don't claim to be a headphone expert, but the sound produced by these headphones is certainly amazing. I was stunned when I heard the bass hitting solidly and accurately, as well as the crisp highs.

Any piece of audio equipment must be evaluated both for sound and for practicality within the intended environment of use.

They close out a great deal of the outside sound (these are not noise-cancelling 'phones, mind you) while also preventing your music from harassing others.  Nearly no sound leakage while the -V6 is on your ears, even at overly high volumes.  Sound quality: not as great as the best of some high-end 'phones, but for outdoor purposes these are more than worth the price.  They are totally comfortable; I've worn them over 10 hours on international flight with no discomfort.  I can tell a real piano from electronic keyboards on 70s dance records on these, and human voices have natural timbres. They handle equally well orchestral, chamber, punk, vocal and jazz.  They also have a solid build; previous models I'd bought from Sony could not handle anything more than delicate use: wires tore, plastic pieces snapped off.  My current pair of -V6s have handled rough use for over three years.I highly recommend these if my descriptions fit your uses for a pair of headphones.

I ran in this headphone by playing music into it continuously for 3 days, and the sound is much better now! I am expecting it will keep improving after about 1 to 3 month(s) to have both drivers settled. (Will update about this part later).3. The sound of this headphone is like what they are designed for. Almost no coloration.Before writing this review, I saw two extreme ends of reviews. Most people were using this pair of headphone for years, and some reviews are cursing Sony MDR-V6... The story may (very likely) be that Sony has discontinued this headphone in Japan, and the replaced model is MDR-CD900ST (V6 was the CD600ST). In Japan, all V6's are actually  &#34;imported&#34;! Sony actually moved the original production line of V6 to China, and later, to Thailand. Since I only own this headphone for one week, I really are not in the position to judge the QA of V6.

After all these are Sony's and I've always had great respect for Sony products. I mean the accompanying pamphlet states they have samarium cobalt magnets with high flux density and 16 micron high-molecule film and copper-clad aluminum voice coil and all that kinda good stuff. These phones even look cool packaged so nicely in a red velvet-like \"bed\". So how could I go wrong?Well, something got lost between spec sheet and ear drum for me. I consider myself not only somewhat of a finicky audiophile but also a musician. I listen to all kinds of music from symphony to jazz to Sinatra and the Beatles to the percussion classics of the 1960's. I put these cans through the paces for two weeks before writing this review.On the plus side, these phones do a nice job of separating and clarifying certain instrumental sections of an orchestra/band. Bass and midrange reproduction is pretty good overall. Not terrific, but pretty good. If you are listening solely to modern recordings with the latest technology you will probably be pleased.But these phones just don't respect percussion, particularly the treble clef. The ching of a finger cymbal, or the sound of a ride cymbal or xylophone on older recordings are barely audible on these Sony's on many of the recordings I listened to. I had to make certain I wasn't losing my hearing and listened to these tracks on my regular stereo system just to reassure myself that those sounds are still alive and well. And folks, my ol' JVC's reproduced those sounds as clear as a bell.Well, maybe it's just me after all and not the phones. But I strongly suggest you do a \"taste test\" with these phones with your fav cd before laying down your hard earned bread on these phones. And I can't help but ask myself, \"How much do I gotta spend to get the kind of phones I can live with?\"All I can say at this point is: \"Damn, I miss my JVC's!!\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, But Not For Audiophiles", "unixReviewTime": 1188172800, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2007"}

Nearly everyone says that the sound quality is so fantastic that it makes up for the uncomfortableness. I decided to go ahead and purchase them. Got them about 10 hours ago. While the sound is truly fantastic and getting better with every hour played (That break-in time suggested is definitely true.) the tightness on my ears is not making me happy. I'm a woman and do not have a big head or ears, in my opinion, and these phones are almost as uncomfortable as my  previous pair of [...] Sony V150s. I'm trying to ignore it and hoping it gets more tolerable, but so far no. Even within a few minutes my ears start itching from the tightness.I am boycotting Bose for their ridiculously inflated prices, but my mom has a pair of the Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, and I LOVE them! [...] though. Yikes! I'm contemplating the Bose Triports I've been testing every time I go to Target. They are light as a feather and the sound seemed good from the demos. However, all reviews complain of the quality of the build on the headband. I don't want to pay [...] just to have the phones fall apart in a few months.So, in my continuing quest I found some reviews on the V6 that mention replacing the pads with a velour pad from Beyerdynamic. The reviews on the difference in comfort are quite convincing. I'm buying these immediately and will report back my findings. [...]All in all, I just wanted to write my review for anyone else that may be waffling on the comfort issue. Many say the sound is so good that it's worth the discomfort. Not for me. Comfort is a huge part of enjoying my time listening to music. I'm not an audiophile either though, so maybe it is worth it for those that can tell the difference in every type of sound. The sound in these is pretty awesome though. A couple of raw recorded songs that I was listening to with talking at the end actually caused me to jump because I thought someone was right behind me. I hope the replacement pads work because the sound quality is excellent, especially at this price.2/8/08 - The pads help some but they still pinch my ears a bit. I found that taking out the middle foam section actually helps give my ear more room to hang out in there, but...... I actually went out and bought the Bose Triports, and while the comfort level was much better, the sound quality compared to the Sony's doesn't even compare, especially if you enjoy bass. I tried to like the Bose enough to justify the [...] I paid for them, but after several days of comparing they have been packaged up and will be returned to Target. The Sony's blow them out of the water. I am going to keep trying to get used to the pinch. That's how much I love these things, just like everyone else writes about. I've been hooked. I'm listening with them right now, and I'm in my own world. The kids could be screaming and I couldn't hear a thing. Probably not the best thing to do to my husband. LOLUPDATE 5/14/08 - still loving these things, but I'm still getting the itchy ear when listening for any length of time. The velour pad replacement has made it 50% better though. The coil cord is also heavy. I can't leave it hang down. I have to pick it up and lay it on my lap so the pull isn't there. (I plug into my hard drive which is on the floor.) All in all though, I'm still very happy with my purchase. One more thing I would suggest, however, is to be careful when you pull the cord out of the jack. Be sure to pull from the metal and not anywhere on the plastic. I can see how these might get broken after a while if you always pull from the plastic. Happy listening!8/25/08 - When you come back to edit your review this many times, you must be passionate about the product. And I am. Still love these phones. I'm used to the tightness now. One of my best purchases for the money.12/30/09 - Well, it's been over a year since my last review. Since then my husband died of cancer in September, and my house burned down 20 days ago. Rough year, to say the least. Anyway, I came back to my review only because since my Sony's burned with my house, I'm buying another pair. I still love them. Someone asked a year ago about the Beyerdynmaic ear pads I bought. I forgot where I got them, but you can just Google beyerdynamic ear pads and places come up. [...] looks like a good buy.

As you may or may not know, most electronic devices perform differently after considerable use, as opposed to directly out of the packaging. In this case, it seems to my ears that the Sony MDR-V6 headphones improve with some performance time under their figurative belt.They sounded good from the beginning, but sound even better now, three months later. All styles of music benefit from these. Even if you do not have a high-end sound system, as I do, you will no doubt notice a considerable improvement in the quality of your various audio devices. I especially like how pristine the music coming from my laptop sounds with these plugged in.Classical and Electronic music sound absolutely radiant with these headphones. Those are the two genres I enjoy most and was eager to hear my Mozart and Tangerine Dream records. The results were impressive. It is quite interesting how a premium device like this really can alter the quality of music you've known so well. There are certain albums of mine, live albums specifically, that sound as if they've been re-mastered. Music produced with conventional instruments (guitar, bass, and drums ect.) sounds well balanced. The 40mm drivers this set contains emit clear and pristine Treble frequencies, while the Bass response is always bold, warm and never distorted. Precisely what one wants in a top-shelf product item this!The issue of comfort is also one you'll never have to worry about. No matter how wide or tall your head may be there are multiple adjustment positions to fit you nicely. The ear cups cover your entire ear and are softly padded with a smooth, rubber-like binding. I have noticed, on some occasions that my ears begin to perspire bit. This is because I sometimes have them on for prolonged listening sessions and not because they are tight.To conclude, Sony has produced a genuinely outstanding product in the MDR-V6. They look, feel and sound exceptionally good. I am happy with my purchase and will likely buy another pair in the not to distant future for my other listening devices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sony MDR-V6: Possibly the best Headsets I've Ever come across.", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012"}

Neutral, balanced, detailed. The overall sound might be described as analog, lacking the bright, hard edge of digital. The bass is warm, the highs present but never jarring. I hear details, especially in the large orchestral works or in sampled-and-layered electronica that go nearly unnoticed through speakers or lesser phones. Though all phones tend to bring out detail to to some extent (they're right on your ears) the sound of these phones enhances that effect without sacrifice to the overall presentation of the music (something most in-ear \"buds\" have always suffered from IMO)My alternates are a pair of comparably priced Sennheisers that are equally praiseworthy but so completely different in design that comparison is hardly fair. They sit on the ears, rather than enclose them. The sound is airy and open, brighter, and you can hear more ambient sound when wearing them.I'd be hard pressed to choose one over the other. Largely a matter of taste but the bottom line is that the Sonys are just more neutral and balanced (not favoring any part of  the aural spectrum). The overall \"analog\" quality of their sound is likely due in part to the enclosed rather than open design.  If you prefer the more open design and associated sound quality of something like the Senns, these may not be for you.The downside if the Sonys for me is that they are about the most uncomfortable phones I've had if worn for longer than a few minutes. They press uncomfortably on my ears and though I have them set at the minimum extension of the head band, they are just not quite short enough, they feel like they want to extend just below my ears.

The reviews I've read on the web that mention reduced midrange are pretty much correct. I just didn't know having small sounding (not tinny) dead centered in your head lead vocals would be the result of it but it is. Same thing listening to DVD's.And this may be due to the different ways certain audio is recorded because Kenny Rankin's vocals on his \"Because of You\" CD sounded live and real due to it being recorded live in a hardwood floor concert stage and, in the words of Chesky Records...\"using minimalist miking techniques and without overdubbing or artificial enhancement to ensure the purest and most natural sound possible\". Another cause for the somewhat echoless disembodied vocals is the sound dampening foam within the ear pieces.Other than that if you like clean, accurate bass right down to near earthquake frequencies, the V6's will deliver with amazing clarity and with very little distortion. As an example about 5 minutes into Propellerhead's \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" during a quiet violin interlude there is a barely audible low resonant bass frequency that doesn't reproduce on my home theatre system with vented sub as well as off my Sony earbuds and other audio equipment. The V6 plays it perfectly without overpowering and muddying delicate detail. And Open Range's gunfight battle, the most realistic I've ever heard in any movie sounded exactly as it did in the theatre on the V6's.However, some live sounding jazz quartets like the ones recorded back in the '60's may loudly resonate very low upright string bass frequencies depending on how it was recorded as it did on some Julie London songs. It had me reaching quickly to adjust the bass on my 1973 Sansui 2000A amp before my ears bled.A noticeable hole exists in the upper midrange that creates that slight bass hum in human vocals talking on a mic is quite evident on the V6's. But that's what they were designed to do anyway and probably the reason why they're favored by radio DJ's and announcers.But hey, nothing's perfect, but for the money these are the best sounding headphones I've ever heard.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Toss your subwoofer if you don't mind small voices in your head.", "unixReviewTime": 1211846400, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2008"}

Aw, what the heck...I purchased my first pair of MDR-V6s when they first came out in the 80s.  You need to realize that a driver that could faithfully reproduce sound down to and BELOW 20Hz was unheard of in consumer audio at that time.  These phones stunned me when I was able to hear content on certain recordings that I had never heard before - mostly in the spectrum from 80Hz and down.  This was an unusual experience via headphones.  The clarity and truthfulness of the audio the MDR-V6s produce is stunning to those who value accurate audio reproduction.  Their ability to deliver very high volume levels without distortion is a joy (in moderation - doing this too often WILL result in hearing loss). They are even more stunning when one considers the price compared to the more esoteric audiophile phones available that can run 10 to 20 times more in price.I had that first pair of phones for about 12 years before someone stepped on the frame and snapped one of the driver's clean off.  I replaced them with a new pair which I still own.  They are pushing 15 years old now and still sound very good.  After an estimated 5000 hours of use, the ear pads are flaking off and the left driver had begun to occasionally break-up on high volume, low frequency content.  So I have ordered my third pair of these beauties over the course of almost 30 years.  Thank you, Sony, for continuing to manufacture this excellent product at an amazing price.A popular trend in headphone design today involves intentional gain manipulation over certain frequencies - mostly on the low end (Beats by Dr. Dre).  If they sound good to you, who am I to tell you different?  I personally enjoy hearing recordings as close to their original mix as possible.  The MDR-V6s do that extremely well.  When you can actually hear the full audio spectrum delivered with very little coloration, you might be surprised at how enjoyable some recordings are with little or no adjustments to the equalization.The only shortcoming on these phones is the fact that the wire that runs from the left ear cup up and over to the right ear cup is exposed where it travels over the stainless steel band on each side. This is a pretty small gauge wire and if you accidentally pulled on it when removing the earphones or pulling them out of a backpack, there is a possibility of the wire being damaged.  And if that wire is ever broken, it is basically impossible to repair.  Nearly all headphones use very fine stranded, coated wiring.  The coating makes it practically impossible to repair once broken.  It cannot be soldered or twisted together.  So if you are rough with your phones, consider this.If accuracy is important to you look no further.

I was going to get exactly the same ones, but was so annoyed about them breaking I wanted to get a different kind of headphones. I did a lot of searching and looking and finally settled on the Sony MDR-V6 headphones.I enjoyed the Sony MDR-V6 headphones right from the start.

I like headphones to have a neutral spectrum, not too much base and good treble as well as a balanced mid range. Between the MDR-V6 and the 280 HD Pro the sound quality seems to be much on par.These headphones are noise isolating so external sounds don't distract. It's not quite as much as what the Sennheiser headphones achieve, but still very good. The 280s exert more pressure around your head. Something I got used to, but I like the lesser pressure from the Sonys better. They weigh less than the 280s, which makes it them even easier to wear for a long time. The cord is longer. For me that's a plus. I can stand and not have the plug dangle in the air and tug on my left ear.The headband looks like it's better quality than on the 280s and they also fold together and fit into the bag that comes with the Sonys.I'm glad I decided to get these headphones and think they are better than the 280s.

The HD598 wins.The Ultrasone HFI-780 has absolutely terrible sibilance/sibilant. This is a common complaint with these cans. The 780 has better bass than the HD598, but the sibilance ruins these cans. Not even listenable.The Sony MDR-V6 (aka MDR-7506) are phenomenal cans, but rather boring. These are some of the most popular headphones ever made, for good reason. They do sound incredible, and they are inexpensive. Every sound is fantastic. However, it can be boring for people who are not used to it. People in the audio industry refer to them as flat, and flat is the perfect way to describe them. And some people love this sound, it grows on you after a while. The MDR-V6 are studio monitors, which mean they are primarily made to be used in a studio or with other professional applications where you can monitor how loud a particular sound is. These cans heavily emphasize the mids, and thats not necessarily a bad thing. Those who love acoustic music or love hearing vocals will prefer these over the HD598. Some treble and some &#34;hissing&#34; can be heard on occasion, but overall these are amazing headphones if you like flat sound. The bass is very nice and never muddles the midrange or treble. Isolation is actually really good. I do have a problem with the left side of the headphone. If I move my head at all, and I mean at all, a part of the headband makes a swearing sound. I fixed it by wrapping some material around it. An easy fix but I should not have had to do this. These cans provide excellent detail, but can also be unforgiving on recordings that are subpar. Overall, excellent phones and I highly recommend them to everyone.The Grado SR80i are another great set of headphones, but they are uncomfortable and dont appear to be made as well as the other headphones on this list. Overall they sound great. The bass is almost non-existent, like the HD598. The overall sound signature was not as clean as the MDR-V6. The MDR-V6 is just so clean and precise, very hard to beat. But the SR80i are still great headphones and I would probably prefer to listen to music and game with them more than the Sony's. The Grado's sound like what you are used to, which is not studio monitor headphones.Now the Sennheiser HD598. I have the least experience with these, but they are so good I dont need extensive experience. They are extremely comfortable, excellent sound reproduction, and excellent soundstage. I've listened to many gaming headphones in the $50 price range and these are several tiers above them in every way. Soundstage is so important in gaming, especially first person shooters. I use these with Battlefield 3 and they always accurately pinpoint all the sounds. Music is crystal clear and silky smooth. No sibilance or harshness ever hear. I do wish they had more bass, but the open nature of these cans makes these bass light.

It's not surprising that you read that a decent amount of professionals use these. I mix everything entirely on these headphones, and when I play them back on other devices such as car speakers or crappy laptops, the mix is still exactly how I want it. You can't mix that accurately with really anything else out there.I also use them with my iPod, and it is excellent.

I simply haven't found anything more comfortable to wear 10+ hours a day, sound great, and are very reasonably priced.While I believe these are the best choice for audio production and post production work, it's important to know that these do not have any noise canceling capabilities.  Professional users working in a studio environment usually don't want or need this feature.  But if you're looking for a set of headphones for tuning out all the chaos at home or on an airplane while listening to music, you will probably be better off with a noise canceling model.That said, I listen to music with these at home all the time, and it sounds fantastic.

I was a recording engineer at the time and a friend who was a boom man on movies turned me on to them. I have tried many other headphones over the years, but these have always been and continue to be the gold standard. Some may not find them as comfortable as other brands, but they get better over time and the sound quality is definitely worth the investment. When these first came out, they were put in Sony's consumer line but as does happen in audio, the pros got turned on to them and before long, they were outselling the headphones in Sony's pro line (who complained loudly :-o). Sony then introduced the 7506 into the pro line and charged more money for them ;-). I remember for a while it was hard to find the V6s. But apparently, so many professionals complained that eventually, Sony made the V6s available again. I don't use these to listen to my iPod for several reasons... number one, they are highly accurate. While that SOUNDS good, what it really means they are very flat in their response... no presence boost, no bass boost... zip, nada! That may make them seem \"dull\" when compared to other headphones but in essence, for a professional who is trying to capture audio accurately, it is a blessing. The second reason is, they are too big to fit in a pocket with your iPod. When done listening, I wrap my etymotics around my iPod and shove the whole thing in my coat pocket, no worries. Even if you fold these guys up, you'll have a tough time getting them in all but the largest pockets. One final thing I can add that has nothing to do with the use of the headphones per se, is the bag that comes with these is a POS. I learned early on that they rip, flake, and basically fall apart. When my first one disintegrated, that same movie sound man turned me onto the perfect replacement.... a Crown Royal bag. The headphones fit perfectly and 15 years later, I'm still using the same bag.

The sound is incredible and the bass shines through during key moments in soundtracks, music, or movies. Just watch Aliens with these on. In other words the bass isn't constantly booming. Even games sound incredible. Just tried them out on Dead Space. Really immersible. People keep pitting these against the Audio Technica M50s. Save yourself the extra 40 dollars. (Most places will price match) You can't go wrong with Sony they are to be trusted and have been around for decades. They continue to impress me by making products designed for any background of sound, not just one genre like the others.

These will not beat you over the head with bass, but I'm saying that you should expect them to lean towards the low end, got it?I also purchased the beyerdynamic earpads that happen to fit this exact model by sony because I read great things about swapping the earpads (the achillies heel of these headphones).

These cans now compete with my Senn's for comfort, but the Senns still come out on top...though I've got no complaints for either anymore!The only thing I really don't like about these are the wires that hang around in the open where the folding part happens to snag.  This causes that little wire to get caught in there when I collapse the headphones sometimes and I worry that it will one day break the wire somehow.

The build quality all the way down to the solid way the headphone clicks into place when you extend each side was superb. Also, the fit was very good, i am 5'11 with a muscular build, and they cover my ears fine.When i put them on, i immediately noticed how quiet everything was, even with music playing low volume, i couldn't even hear myself typing this review on my very loud razer blackwidow keyboard that clicks every time you strike a key.The V6 is an older design (more than 15 years old), and it shows. Persoanlly though, i like the design and the look. It's very different from the all-plastic designs common to other inexpensive Sony headphones. The headband is wrapped in pleather, with minimal padding. Length-adjustable metal strips attach the earpieces to the headband. The driver housings are of black metal, a plus. The cups are covered in crinkled pleather. The coiled cord is one meter long at rest, but extends to three, and attaches to the left earpiece. The plug is a mini; the 1/8\" adapter (included) screws on, to prevent accidental extraction. Both plug and adapter are nickel plated, rather than gold like the more expensive MDR 7506 (basically the same headphone with different stickers, gold plating on the jack, and an extended warranty), which is the only visible sign of the V6's relatively low price bracket. The V6 folds, in the manner of some of Sony's other headphones; that is, the ear pieces swing up under the band, to form a more compact package. After this treatment the V6 fits into the black pleather bag it comes with.Since the range is so large (5hz-30khz) you can hear everything, including the distortion of not well leveled sound. But that's whey these were made for the studio, and not really for personal listening. i am really glad that whenever i download songs, i make sure they are 192kbps or above. You can really hear any subtle nuances of instruments in the backround which is really an added plus. So if you get these headphones, make sure your music files are up to par.I cannot believe that that these headphones are under 100, and even further disbelief that i did not buy these earlier, they are one of the best headphones i have ever put on. Forget beats, go oldschool and get these studio monitors.Okay, these arnt all perfect, by now, my ears are getting a bit warm (lack of ventilation) but i guess that comes with any over ear headphones. Also, with thourough research, i found that the padding flakes off (the leather isnt real) BUT they can be replaced for under 20 bucks. Another padding that fits is the padding of Beyer DT-250 headphones which some say are a bit more comfortable, but i like these fine. These V6's last a very very long time, and is a great investment. I highly suggest it, you wont regret it.Also, a friend told me to let these play for a couple hours on high volume to \"break them in\".

This will horrify some people, but I'm not all THAT picky when it comes to sound.  I'm happy listening to movies and TV through my TV's speakers (though to be fair, I always try to buy a TV with good sound).  I'm content with the headphones that come with my iPod-that sort of thing.So on the audio front, my opinion probably doesn't mean that much.  That said, I could instantly tell that the sound on these was far better than my iPod headphones.  It's as good as anything I can recall hearing.That's actually not why I bought these though.  I work in a very loud environment.  It seems to be over 70db, and I've long been concerned that it might be wrecking my hearing.  I've tried using the ear protection gear I wear while mowing, but it's just not comfortable for long periods.  I finally started wondering if a good pair of headphones that enclose your ears would help...And as it turns out, they do.  These cut a significant amount of noise out, to the point that I'm pretty sure they really are helpful for my hearing.  Not as much as the actual hearing protection stuff, but the difference in noise when I take them off after wearing them for a while is huge.I was also concerned about how comfortable these would be, given the mixed reviews in terms of comfort.  At least for me, these are very comfortable.  I've been wearing them every day, 8 hours a day, and have no complaints.  I can feel them if I think about it, but the cushioning is soft and comfortable, and to me they just feel like they're gripping my head lightly-not unlike how a hat feels, I guess.  (For the record, I wear glasses, and these don't interfere with them at all.)So at any rate, they seem very well built, they sound great to my ear, they're comfortable, and they seem to block a substantial amount of noise.  They're one of the few products that I can recommend wholeheartedly...Well, I guess just to nitpick, the size adjustments on the side don't always stay in the same spot from where they were when I took them off the previous day, but that's really no big deal.

I had used beats and monster and Skullcandy from friends, and they all seemed to focus on skull-smashing bass. When i wanted to use them to listen to Vivaldi or Chopin or some other classical or romantic composer, or to the more synthy electronica, they all just fell flat. Before i gave up, i did some research and heard a lot of good things about these headphones and how they sported a very &#34;Full&#34; sound that had a respectable bass that didn't overwhelm the other finer sounds, i tentatively grabbed them expecting to have to return them.I was HAPPILY disappointed. These sounded like nothing i had ever heard before. If you like really LOUD music, these aren't for you, but as far as being FULL sounding, and being able to pick out the FINER elements in a piece, these proved themselves without a shadow of a doubt.They are not noise CANCELLING but they still reduce outside sounds substantially.The audio bleed is almost non-existent. You can have your iPod or Zune up to nearly max and only barely be audible to people nearby. I can jam in the middle of class and no one even notices, (just the sound, they are still quite visible so be careful ;P  ).The cord is quite long which is a double edged sword. You can plug it into your computer and sit 10+ feet away with little discomfort, but when you are walking around, the cord is quite difficult to manage. I just stuff as much of it as i can in my pocket, and hold it there while i walk. Definitely not suitable for running or exercise unless the cord is secured on your person some way.I've had these for over a year I think, and the pads are only just beginning to wear, but that is easy to replace.These headphone are actually very comfortable despite their appearance. It took some getting used to, but i am able to wear them for hours with little to no discomfort.Really the only thing i worry about is the placement of the little cable that attaches to each headphone. They give these a lot of slack so that the headphones have free rotation about the horizontal pivot, but i'm always afraid i won't be paying attention and i'll slip the little cable between the headphone and it's stabilizing bar where it would get caught and maybe even cut that cable. This has not even come close to happening while I've had them, but it's always in the back of my mind.Last but not least, be very careful with the jack. I'm sure it can take natural wear and tear, but if you step on it accidentally like i did and bend it, the right earphone will not work. I have to wiggle the jack a little bit to get them both to work again every once in a while. I would never have had to do that, if i'd have left them on the table. As far as being tossed around and dropped though, these are surprisingly durable.These are the best sounding headphone i have ever used, (besides Bose but screw that price tag), and my only regret was stepping on them.

The phones still work but the left earpiece doesn't remain attached. It is a testament to the quality of build for the hadphones. I figured it was a sign to move on, but what should I get? The MDR-V5 were no longer available. Time to revisit the MDR-V6.Well, I couldn't be happier. I wish I has purchased these 18 years ago instead of the V5s. The earpiece covers my ears and rests comfortably on my head. The cord is coiled instead of straight and the sound quality is a nice flat curve. Ideal for studio monitoring. There is no over-amping of bass and no artificial high-end, just plain honest headphones. I also enjoy that they come with a pretty decent leatherette carrying case. The headphones fold up nicely to save space.The only negative is that back when they were producing these in the 80s and 90s they came with gold connectors. The new versions do not, however I kept the gold connector from my V5s so I'm still pretty happy.I did compare these to the professional version of this headphone MDR-7506.

Unless, that is, any music is playing. In which case no outside noise gets in, and practically none gets out (unless you have your music very loud. If it's loud enough to be easily heard outside of these headphones I fear for your hearing). So great sound isolation.All in all, for the price especially, these are the best.

The fuzzy fabric beneath ends up being more comfortable than the vinyl, since it 'breathes' and your ears stay cooler.Electrostatic discharge (zaps to your ears, in a dry wintry environment);  I fixed that, by removing one ear cup, and attached a fine brass wire loop that I grounded to the neutral wire that serves the L & R drivers.  This fine wire shows / is visible inside the ear cup.  In use, this rests on my ear (not detectable as pressure on the ear) and constantly drains off any static electricity buildup.

The sound production is very good.  I've only tried it through my phone's music player using high bitrate mp3's so not exactly the best source, so I'm not going to dig too deep into sound quality.  I'll just say that I am happy with the sound production.On the comfort side, the cups are pretty comfortable.  I've repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears.  The only slight discomfort I experienced was from the head band.  I wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head.  As it is, the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile.  But that could just be the shape of my head.In terms of manufacturering, the product feels quality made, from the band all the way down to the end of the plug.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1346198400, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2012"}
