Four stars because the volume dial broke and the sound would still be present even with the dial all the way down. luckily it still pumps out max volume though. I put a peace strong tape on the dial in fear of it breaking further. It might have been my rough handeling of the speaker sometimes so normally this shouldnt happen. battery life could be longer or at least a more accurate battery indicater. otherwise this speaker is amazing. one more thing idk if its just me but when i daisy chain it to another micro the sound dims down and sounds pretty muffled. not as noticble with some songs but just another slight problem.",

I have many of them over the years from Altec Lancing, Sony, logitech, cambridge sound works, bose, and now JBL I do have to say some of the brands I had bought a while ago and needed replacing. So my wife got me a bose mini for christmas. This review is not a comparison to the bose mini. That speaker system is well known at this point. The JBL though not as loud and full sounding as the bose does do a great job in sound reproduction. The reason I have purchased yet another speaker system is that I wanted something more portable than the sound link mini. Something that I could fit in my pocket but still sound good. I am pleasantly surprised on how well this speaker system works. I would defiantly suggest getting the wireless version as this is the main speaker to my iPad. The built in speaker is not that great in the iPad. I find the volume control on the unit useless as  you prone or tablet will control the audio volume. I think this speaker is great if you want something that will sound really good and fit in your pocket. If you want something that sounds great and completely fill a room then get a bigger speaker system.",

I have been looking for a speaker dock or wireless speaker to replace my iHome cube speaker dock, since I got a new phone.  While I was sort of looking for something that sounded great and also charged my phone, I have no regrets about purchasing this speaker!  The sound quality is amazing, and it's very small so you can put it just about anywhere.  Battery life seems very good, and I like that it doesn't drain the battery on my phone either.  I just got it, so I haven't used it too much yet, but I can tell I'm going to get a lot of use out of it.  I also like that since it's wireless, as opposed to my previous speaker dock, it will work with any smartphone that I may have down the road.You may look at this and think it's kind of expensive for such a tiny gadget, but I think it's totally worth it.

They are super clear for the highs and mids and the sound carries very well.

The speaker is small and easy to tuck into a corner of the room or a shelf. And of course it is ultra portable. Blue tooth range before the connection became choppy is about 20-30ft.",

When it arrived, my wife and I took a look at it and both thought there wasn't a chance we were going to be satisfied with this little speaker.  It connected easily with my HTC Droid DNA  phone and my Nexus 10 tablet, and I was thankful for that.  Turned it on and we were both completely blown away with the rich fullness of the sound.  I've asked several of our friends and family (some young and some old) to take a listen, and not having seen the reviews in advance, they have all been shocked by how good it sounds.

Without having heard it before purchasing, I was dubious as to the sound quality of such a small device. Here's the deal: If you want room filling, bass-thumping sound, this isn't it. If you want convenience and clarity, you just found it. So, if you keep in mind that it's a portable, personal listening device and it ain't gonna &#34;rock the party,&#34; you'll like it a lot. I've heard the Jamz, the Gorilla G-Grip and a few other small mono BT speakers, but this takes the crown and the more narrow design makes it easier to carry around. There are unexpected lows and clear mids/highs for something this size - honestly, I don't know how they do it. Another plus is the built-in 1/8&#34; cable for non-BT players (like my iPod Classic), so you don't have to carry around an additional cord. It's also connects via my Motorola 30-pin BT adapter for the Classic. Connectivity is a breeze. It's extremely versatile and sounds good hanging, sitting up or laying flat. I'm a fan.",

I took a chance on this lil guy and have nothing but a good experience with it.  Say will play up to 5 hrs, I have gotten well over 10 hrs and still was playing before I shut it off to head home.  Sound quality is clear as can be with no complaints.  Easy to pair with my phone.  The only thing I though i would chang is the volume mechanism when I first receive the device.  I find the ease and function of it to be more beneficial.  May not look very techy but believe this was the best when it comes to ease of uses when turning and adjusting volume.

My wife has the JAM bluetooth speaker and thought of all the reasonably priced bluetooth speakers out there(and there are a lot) this one sounds the best for $50 bucks.She was shocked at the volume level and crisp sound it produced the day we got it streaming from my phone. I was too. At max volume, never gets distorted.Keep in mind, garbage in, garbage out. If you play a poorly recorded or poorly converted song. It's not gonna sound any better than the source file it's playing from. But most songs from Amazon mp3 store and iTunes sound great. Definitely the bluetooth speaker to buy if your looking for one.Now if you want to spend more than $50 bucks check out the JBL Charge, or others that are beyond the $50 price point. This had excellent reviews and I see why. It connects very easy and sounds great.Connecting could not be easier. Press the power button, go to your phone and scan for new devices in the bluetooth section. Then your set. Pops up right away and your jamming. A+++",

    "reviewText": "Just picked up the JBL Micro Wireless. The design is similar to the JBL Micro II with one slight exception, in that its got a slightly bigger and raised grill. This helps the sound to spread a bit more when its lying face up.The sound is great for a pocket speaker. Loud enough to fill a decent sized room with background music. In fact, if you are too close to it, you may want to turn down the volume as it gets pretty loud. Mids and Treble are its strong points. Voices sound natural. Acoustic music is excellent. Bass is present, but don't expect too much from its 1.5 inch driver. Placement close to a wall does make it sound warmer. You need to note that if you are using any form of EQ, then the upper register needs to be toned downed a slight bit or kept flat with songs which have a lot of cymbal splashesThe JBL Micro Wireless performs quite well over Bluetooth. Range is >40ft line of sight. It supports AVRCP and you can control volume, track selection etc. from you source device. Battery life is as advertised and you get about 5 hrs at almost full volume.It has an Aux / Audio out port. This enables it to be daisy chained to other JBL Micro speakers for a louder mono sound. This can also be used as a Bluetooth adapter if you connect it to your home music system.This is a great little speaker. Though it's mono, the sound is excellent for its size. Stereo sound with such small speakers doesn't make sense. I have the Soundmatters FoxL V2 aptX speaker and also previously had the JBL Flip. You basically cannot make out any separation once those speakers are about a foot away from you. So, mono works fine for this type of a speaker..Negatives, though few at this price point and size, would be that the cable should have been detachable, the battery life should have been around 10 hrs, and this is nitpicking.Suggestions for the next generation Micro (III):1. Make the unit slightly bigger to fit a 2\" or 2.5\" driver, keeping the overall design the same.2. Increase output to about 10W (its possible with slightly bigger drivers).3. Add a slightly bigger battery to give a back up of about 10-12hrs.4. Add DSP to control bass output at all volumes.",

It is small but can give out a hearty sound. Tried to set it up to full volume which can be found at the speaker itself and noticed minimal distortion which one will not notice unless you are trying to hear for any distortion. The only thing I could not get it to work is that when I use Skype, sound will not transfer to the speaker and still uses the laptop's speaker. Any suggestions? But this is easily fix by using the speaker's built in jack. Still I give this little monster 5 stars.",

    "reviewText": "After trying around 10 different mini speakers for my cellphone this my favorite.  I also have the flip.  This guy is not far behind the flip in quality and volume.The rundown:Just tried a bunch of these ranging from $20-$60:HMDX jam bluetooth - third place - sounds awesome, it's the loudest of all tested as well. Great bass and does not distort too much at the loudest volumes. nice, solid weight.  However a constant buzzing/fuzzy noise made this a no go. Also resets to 50% volume every time it is powered on and off just like all the others except the JBL.  would be my second favorite if it didn't have the buzz. well priced at 35.Satechi bluetooth audio cube - not loud at all, tinny sound, very little bass, sounds muffled. expected more from the large size of the unit(about 3.5*3.5\") compared to others, and the positive reviews. looks cool.  overpriced at 50 for sure.Kinivo wired - not very loud but otherwise great sound. nice bass, clear highs.  distorts a little at max volume. cool looking.  great value at 20Sharkk bluetooth - second place - a best buy at 27 bucks. sounds great, good bass, and not much distortion on max volume. not quite as loud as the jbl or hmdx though.  bland looking.  Comparable volume to most of the others though.JBL micro bluetooth - my favorite - first place. stylish, great volume, clear highs and great bass. Very user friendly and uses a manual volume dial so each time you turn it on it is at the previous volume. most reset to 50% every time you turn them off and back on.  Also can be used as a bluetooth adaptor/dongle where the 3.5mm out can plug into any home theater system.  Nice spot to hang it up on a nail, making the sound project farther and louder. Also has a small flat area on the side opposite the hook so it stands up by itself and it doesn't fall over even at max volume with bass heavy rap playing, meaning you can aim the speaker.  This actually makes the speaker louder than the hmdx for real world usage.  With extremely heavy bass music the mids and highs \"fade out\" a little bit at max volume since a single driver can only handle a certain amount of range.  Otherwise it does not distort even at max volume.  pricey at 60 but worth it.  great battery life too, more than the advertised 5 hours.  Also, re-connects with bluetooth devices automatically when they come in range, so no need to manually reconnect constantly like with other speakers.  Can daisy chain with other micros also.August bluetooth - decent quality and bass, however distorts at fairly low volumes making it a no go.  Similar to the sharkk in size, weight and sound.Satechi BT wireless portable speaker - worst of all, distorts at the slightest bit of bass or volume. Instant no go and a rip off at 40 bucks. can also be used as a bluetooth dongle like the jbl though. Looks almost identical to the kinivo.  has horrible buttons that perform multiple functions and are super sensitive leading accidental skipping of songs, turning off, etc.  stay away from satechi.Xmini - bluetooth drops easily. by far the lightest and smallest and has good sound for it's size but little bass and not too loud.  If you want portability and lightweight this is the way to go. The alpatronix is small too but heavier.  pricey at 40 for what you get.Alpatronix bluetooth - sounds great, but distorts quickly with any bass heavy music.  Also \"walks\" across the table with bass heavy songs unlike the others due to it's weight/bass ratio.  Loud, like the jbl and hdmx.  40 bucks is too much unless you don't listen to anything but classical at low volumes.",

Even though this speaker is bluetooth compatible, I always plug in the device to a speaker outlet on my laptop or my iphone.  The speaker cord is somewhat short, but when you see the way the cord wraps around the device for storage, it is easy to understand why the cord was designed to the specific length.  And if that issue really bothered me, I would simply purchase an extension, or I would use the bluetooth feature.  I have never had the internal battery drain to its minimum, but almost anytime I use the speaker with my laptop, I plug in the USB charger.  I guess anyone can find fault with any product.  I have a tendency to look at the product rating, then I read the worst reviews so that I can look for those specific issues.

I like my speakers/headphones to have crisp, clear sound with deep bass.  I also believe that I can have all that without paying the outrageous MSRP for high end products like Bose.  I've listened to a handful of mini bluetooth speakers and for the size/price this little guy cannot be beat!  It powered right up out of the box, paired easily with my phone, and blew me away with its sound performance.  It easily fills a room or an entire floor of the house with crisp, clear sound and actually punches quite a bass punch.  It won't make you feel it in your chest or anything, but it's full and deep enough to easily notice it's there.  JBL did a great job with its design - very noticeable difference when you pick it up compared to when you put it on a flat/hard surface.  For a speaker that fits in the palm of your hand, this is THE best that I've found.  I would highly recommend this mini speaker!",

I bought this specifically to bring to work with me, as I work in a machine shop, the noise level can make even a full radio hard to hear and wearing headphones is very inconvenient for me, let alone probably a little dangerous.I mounted some nice neodymium magnets to the back of this little thing so I can just stick it to a machine where I'm working and listen to music at my leisure without having to lug around a boom box or run extension cords.  I can hear it from quite a distance if the shop is running normally and have no problem hearing it at my workstation when things get really noisy.Bluetooth range is pretty standard at 30 feet or so and battery life is acceptable at around 4.5-5.5 hours at full volume for most of my music.I definitely would recommend this product for the shear portability, though I'm sure some audiophiles would be displeased with it, as it is a MONO speaker.",

So far I have tested the bluetooth to at least 50' with no issues whatsoever.The battery tends to last somewhere in the realm of 8 hours or so at 50-75% volume for most of its use which is perfectly acceptable.My only negative comment is the bluetooth only can remember one device at a time, so if my fiance used it last I have to re-pair my phone to it.

However, knowing JBLs high reputation for speakers I decided to take the plunge and purchase this product. I have zero regrets! This thing sounds awesome even maxed out on volume on both my phone and speaker. It easily fills my 800 sq home. Don't get me wrong it doesn't supplement speakers for a house. I am just saying it sounds clear throughout the house. I can even hook it up to my computer speakers and transmit songs from the iPhone or ipad. This is great for parties since you can simply pass around your iPhone or ipad for guests to control the music.

You of course can still use your devise to control from the source, but this allows you to make sure your max volume level doesn't get too loud.I really like this product!",

If you want to clip this, the clip should rotate or be placed 90 degrees perpendicular to itself. The power button is easily triggered during travel in a pocket or bag. In fact, practically every time I pull this out of my pocket the power is on and the volume is not where I left it.The sound quality is okay.

What it does do, par excellence, is travel around the house (and on trips, etc) with me and provide good sound at a reasonable level-- no having to blast away so I can hear it as a wander from room to room and floor to floor. You actually could hook it to a belt or whatever. Very good purchase!",

HMDX Jam, Veho VSS-006-360BT, Jambox, Big Jambox, Jabra solemate, Philips ShoqBox, Logitech UE Boombox, Zimri mini Bluetooth, and creative D80. The JBL speakers are the best sounding in my opinion. They have the best frequency range and accuracy. The micro sound quality is compared to the flip is a little thin and has less bass output. Still it's about 7-8 tenths of the sound quality and it's loud enough for a small gathering. Bluetooth range is about 35' and easy to pair. It's well built and has a nice simple classy design. The on off tone is not annoying and the LED is not annoyingly bright like so many other speakers. My only complaint is that it has a mechanical volume that can over time start to crackle and cut out. For $59.95 it should have electronic volume. Even with that issue I think it's priced fair.",

The iHM60 is nothing compared to this one, in terms of sound quality. The JBL seems to be well-made, but it would have been nice if it was made out of metal like the Sharkk speaker. As long as I don't drop it on concrete I think it should be fine. The cool thing about the JBL is that I can charge it with my phone's charger.

Furthermore, I only expected the battery to last a couple hours max, the battery ended up lasting about 8 hours with volume at ~70%. A friend of mine has a small solar powered battery charger for phones and such, I was able to charge the speaker back up in an hour or two and we got right back to it.

Once I got both going I was very pleased with the JBL.  It has great sound for such a small device and far exceeded my expectations.  The Oontz is great too.

The thing is slightly smaller than the Altec Lansing, but sounds MUCH better.  In fact the bass on this is really good for the small size, Bluetooth connectivity is solid (I have an Asus Infinity that I mainly use this from).

It plays louder than any road noise and has a great bass return. I could not be happier with this.The sounds quality is just outstanding. It pairs with my iphone bluetooth and charges with a USB. I have it plugged right into my dual lighter charger. One slot for iphone the other for the speaker. It also has a hard wire via the headphone jack which I recommend if you're playing it in close proximity of your phone just for battery life purposes. In my home I can go a couple rooms away with my phone and not interrupt the speaker play at all. You won't be sorry with this purchase.",

    "reviewText": "As a very satisfied owner of an almost antique JBL bookshelf speaker system and a mp3 docking station I can attest to the company's overall craftsmanship. I've even owned an outdoor setup circa 1990s, that held its own until a tree limb took it out of business. The company has had a good run with products that I've purchased. So when I picked up this bluetooth speaker I knew what kind of quality this gear brings to the table. I bought several of these as Christmas gifts in different colors. Everyone loves them.Out of the box this speaker is impressive. I like the overall feel and balance. Measuring in at about 3\"W x almost 2\"H, it weighs in at a little over 4 ounces. The speaker kit is packed with a 36\" micro USB charging cable, storage pouch, warranty card, and instructions. Even though its doesn't take a degree in rocket science to start this puppy up, the company loses points for its ho hum instructions. The body is outfitted with a handle for mounting a lanyard or carabiner. I opted to add a nylon lanyard. I picked up a protective storage case and dumped the storage pouch.After a quick two hour charge, I first connected this puppy to my mp3 player. No problems. Afterwards I tried this speaker out with my Galaxy 3. Again, no problems. The power button is located on the side. With 3 watts of power, this model is not going to be accused of shaking the paint off the walls. No matter what I had connected, this model delivered my tunes with clear, crisp highs and a nice rich bass. Unlike other gear that I've used in the past, I got zero distortion.As advertised, I got almost a full five hours before it was time to recharge. When fully juiced a bright blue light illuminates at the 12 o'clock position on the front of the unit. It grows paler after a few hours of use. When you see red its time to recharge. I'm glad the company went with a built in Li ion battery. Volume is dial controlled. Piggybacking an additional speaker via the speaker port was easy and gave me a solid stereo. The rubber no slide grip is a great ad on.Overall I'm quite pleased with this JBL speaker. I even like the speaker more then I thought I would. It is a reliable product that delivers quality sound when and where I want it. That's good enough for me.",

Ease of use is also five stars. It seems to come on automatically when blue-tooth is available. I haven't had the battery go dead yet.As for sound quality I can compare it to the Jawbone Jambox Mini. The JJ Mini had clearer, sharper audio to my ear. But lacked bass and overall what I call blast, loudness or sound projection. For intended portable use overall the JBL was a clear winner.I did not try daisy chaining(DC) two JJ Mini's together. But I did DC the JJ Mini and the JBL. Here the JBL again was louder compared to the DC JJ Mini in this configuration.The most pleasant surprise was DCing a JBL with Bluetooth, to the same JBL without Bluetooth. They work together marvelously and saved me around $20.00 in not having to have two of these, both with Bluetooth. Since the combination works so well together, combined with the JBL's functionality, is like having a mini jukebox that can utilize my Smartphone or Ipod for source in my pocket. (I don't like headphones or earbuds.) Like Robert Klein's old 70's comedy routine, &#34;Every Record Ever Recorded, Three Tractor Trailers full, driven to your door, for only a dollar a week.&#34; Now every record and every station is in my pocket with a sound system to boot.",

The analog dial allows for fast adjustment of volume, rather than  '+' or '-' buttons you have to continuously press to get the volume to change, and whose settings might get cleared out. With the analog volume dial, you are guaranteed to have the volume you left it at, and have a much more convenient and fast way to change the volume.",

She purchased one based on a friends' recommendation, and she instantly fell in love with the quality of sound.  She also pointed out that this little gem had over 700 reviews with a rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars.  So after reading several of the reviews, I decided I'd try it out.  Within two days of placing the order, my speaker arrived on my doorstep, and in less than a minute, I paired the speaker to my phone and started enjoying beautiful, rich quality sound from incredible piece of pint size technology!  I LOVE IT!  I already know as soon as my 18 year old son comes out of his room and hears this sound from this little baby, he's going to try and confiscate my speaker.  Oh, but I've got news for him.  He will just have to wait until Friday, because that's when he will get his.  Yep, as soon as I finish this review, I'm ordering one for him and one for my husband as well! :-)",

The sound on this one was definitely richer, with great bass and much less distortion at higher volumes.  The one thing we liked better about the Simply Vibe was the skip forward or backward selection control on the speaker.  With the blue tooth it's easy to get separated from your iPad or iPhone so it's nice to be able to have some control from the speaker, but for sound, this one was the winner.

After doing some looking around online I found this speaker and decided to buy it for her.I gave it to her early because I knew she'd be able to use it and I bought it so she could, so why not just give it to her as an early present?The packaging is really simplistic, as well as the instruction manual. To be honest I actually feel the instructions may actually be TOO SIMPLE and can lead to frustration if you can't get it working properly.I had no issues pairing the bluetooth connection up to my iPhone 5, but when it came to pairing up the speaker with my Mother's Samsung Galaxy S4, it took some trial and error to get the speaker to work. The phone was complaining that the speaker didn't have the right pass code, the speaker apparently thought it was connected, but no sound came out.After messing with the phone and the speaker for awhile I finally got it to connect and work. Let me start off by saying this speaker really puts out the volume! Not only is it loud and sound excellent, but the base on such a small speaker is amazing. I was really impressed.There is a volume toggle on the side of the speaker so you can manually turn the sound up and down. The package claims it has a battery life of about 5 hours.I guess if I had any kind of complaint, it would be that the speaker isn't 100% compatible with apps and that's not really their fault, it's more of a Android issue. One of the music programs my Mother uses, refuses to run unless there is something directly plugged into the headphone jack (it will NOT recognize bluetooth devices.) Another App she uses for a radio (not Pandora) and the sound just doesn't come out.Besides that, this is a great device and I may end up picking up one for myself in the future.",

Therefore, I try to find a bluetooth speaker good that is good for traveling.  I have few criteria on this speaker.  The sound must be reasonable fine with compact size and light weight.  It seems like a mission impossible because there is no such speaker will provide good sound with light weight, so I aimed for the small size criterion first.  I saw this speaker with lots of good reviews in my amazon search.  Okay, I just gave it a try.  The moment I unboxed it, I am impressed by the weight (the size is good too, but I knew how big was it by the description).  It is very light.  Then, I paired it with my iPad.  The sound is greater than I expect.  It is not perfect, but it is much better than I thought.  I really do not know how to describe it, but it is not bad at all.  The only thing I can complain is mono, but for some reasons, it does not bother me at all.  Last but not least, the price is affordable.",

    "reviewText": "Since my car stereo system got stolen I've just been using portable speakers, so I can bring them in and out of the car. I've had a few Bluetooth speakers over the last couples years, all of which ran out of battery quite quickly, had poor sound quality, or didn't go loud enough. I like listening to music at a fairly loud volume, and I listen to some music with pretty strong baselines, so I always had trouble finding a good speaker. My last speaker was always at its highest volume and the base sounded a bit staticky, but I figured it wouldn't get much better with a compact speaker.When the last one broke I grabbed this one at Target, charged it with the USB on my computer and powered it up. Bluetooth pairup was easy and intuitive. Imagine my surprise when I turned it on and the sound quality was incredible, better than any other speaker I've owned. I wanted to see how loud it could go and turned it up and eventually had to stop cause it got so loud, still with amazing sound quality. It comes with a cute little carrying bag and a clip on the top, and fits easily in my purse.I've used it so far every day for 5 days for at least an hour and haven't had to recharge yet. I now use it at home because the speaker is even better than my computer's speakers. It even passed what I like to call the &#34;Drunk in Love&#34; test, because that baseline sounded perfect! I always figured I had to choose between compact size, good sound quality and high volume, but this little device has proved me wrong. I'd recommend this to everyone and plan to buy my mother one for Mother's Day this year :).",

I like these speakers a lot, but I am surprised to see JBL describing them as having surprisingly strong bass.I have JBL HT speakers, so nothing against JBL, but I these are not speakers that reproduce bass in what would be described as strong or powerful, in fact it is their greatest weakness. The bass is there; it's just not strong, but in spite of that, these speakers grew on me over time.Overall I think these little speakers are as good as is possible considering the limitations of size but every speaker has it's tradeoffs--this one is super portable and sounds nice but not as full a sound as I would like.The bluetooth range on these JBL speakers outside is approximately 90'. While they will sit upright, stability is poor. I used them for probably 6 hours and never recharged them. Volume is OK for me outside (I have neighbors) and just about what you would expect from this size speaker, but that's a relative thing. The priced dropped $10 after I received mine and surprisingly Amazon does not have a price guarantee. The lower price is a good thing, however.The bottom line: If the small size is important to you, these are recommended. If you could use a larger size, I would look elsewhere.I will sacrifice some portability for a more balanced sound. The speakers I want will be used primarily on my patio.  I returned my JBL Micro and I am rethinking what I want in a rechargeable, portable, bluetooth speaker. I'm not sure that I can find what I want in this size. I am now looking at Creative D100 and D200 and similar speakers.  But, heck, if I find that I need speakers in this size, I'll reconsider these!",

Includes a nicely hidden, approximately 12\" cable, terminated with a gold plated 3.5mm phone plug that mates with most headphone jacks. Most people will connect through the Bluetooth interface. The bottom has a non-slip surface that also minimizes \"rattle\" against the surface where this unit resides.Fully Windows 8 compliant and only takes a few minutes to get installed and going. It automatically connects to my PC whenever I turn on the speaker. Press the \"ON\" button, a blue LED turns on, wait a couple of seconds for a beep and you are connected and ready to operate. Fantastic!Comes with a mini USB to USB cable that allows charging from a USB port or a cheap USB power adapter available elsewhere. Also, included is a cloth case with draw-string for closing. This is adequate for storage.Includes a hanger. Connect to a strap around your neck while grilling.JBL deserves every one of the 5-star rating. I wish that I could give them more.",

No real complaints thus far.I work in a factory making automotive parts and our employee leadership is very relaxed about having music on while you're working so I figured this would be perfect for my station!I have two things to mention before I say anything else ---First. It took me a while to figure out I had to hold down the power button to get the bluetooth to work which I thought was a little weird because I had just assumed it would automatically search for bluetooth devices.Second. My workplace is VERY loud. The presses are about the size of semi-truck trailers and all that machinery makes a lot of noise.With that being said I am very satisfied with the volume this little speaker can reach. I usually have to have it up all the way but I get enough volume to fill my station with music and I can actually understand and jam to it. Now it is not loud enough for anyone else in my bay to hear it but for regular home use one could presumable EASILY fill an entire room with music or whatever else you're listening to.I wouldn't recommend this speaker to somebody looking to make quick presentations though because it's just not THAT loud.Rated 4 stars because I felt it was a little pricey for what you get.Quality build, decent product, but I'm just not sure this is worth $60.The battery life only being about 3 hours is my main complaint.I often find myself wishing I had just pitched in the extra $40 for the Flip but I am a special circumstance!For regular/personal use in environments that aren't extremely loud like construction yards or factories -- this little guy will work great!",

I haven't heard anything else in this category.I've read it doesn't get loud enough or distorts at higher volumes, which I have not noticed. While it won't rattle walls or windows, it does get loud enough in a room to annoy others in the house.If it doesn't get loud enough, I'd suggest getting a speaker with a driver larger than 1.57 inches (40mm), or an amp that puts out more than 2.7 watts, or both.I listen to mostly rock; from Aerosmith to ZZ Top, including  Godsmack, Disturbed, and Pink Floyd, among many others, and it handles all quite well.Here's the cons:Charging cord is only 15 1/2 inches-From tip of connecter to tip of connecter. The cord itself is 12 3/4 inchesLinking cord is only 12 inches from body to tip of connecter. The cord itself is 10 7/8 inches......Both of these issues are easily & cheaply overcome.If you're not using the linking cord, the unit will not sit flat on a table or whatever because the connector stored in the bottom of the unit is thicker than it's resting spot.If size matters-The unit size is 3.25 inches by 1.56 inches (83mm x 39mm)Hope this helps",

I was pleased with the Micro's smoothness and detail with whatever program material I feed it compared to the louder but less pleasing HMDX Jam. Vocals are clear and music has excellent balance of tonality and detail. At full volume you won't get the advertised five hours of uninterrupted audio but what you will get is a very enjoyable listening experience. The controlled bass response coming out of something this size is remarkable and it never gets in the way of other instruments or vocals. My only nit is the hockey puck form factor with the less than useful integrated hook on its side, but placing it flat on the surface or hanging it in the air still results in pleasurable audio wherever you go. Bluetooth connection is solid and reliable. The JBL Micro Wireless is roughly twice the cost of the HMDX Jam but the performance is well worth the extra bucks. Try one, or both as I did and hear the difference for yourself.",

This speaker is SMALL, and if you're expecting booty-shaking, body-bumping bass, then you're delusional.  Not going to come from any brand in a speaker this size.  If you've got the dough and can tolerate something bigger, then splurge for the Bose ($300) and you'll have your bass.  For the size and price, this speaker delivers.  Highly recommend.",

They are great little speakers, but they have to be physically attached to my iPhone or Macbook to play.  When I saw that they now have a Bluetooth, I jumped at buying one.  It is even better than the last one.  Besides being wireless, as others have mentioned, the case is formed so that it can stand on its side and pointed directionally; very nice.  Secondly, it has a little handle for carrying or hanging, very nice, also.  Thirdly, you can plug it in like an iPhone or iPad to charge.  Much better than going through AAA batteries.So, a great new evolution to an already fine product.",

I tried this one vs the JBL Flip and I can honestly say that the sound difference is negligible. The device itself is about the size of a hockey puck (slightly larger) and weighs almost nothing. The sound quality is clear, bass is adequate, and the volume can be brought all the way up without suffering any loss of sound quality. For me the only minor drawback is no speaker phone capability for incoming calls but that is only for those of us who have a bad speaker phone on the cell phone. I don't so I don't care. If you are looking for a small, long lasting, portable device to listen to music or other media then you need look no further. For the price, this is the best available value to be found.

My wife and I travel frequently, and I always bring a small travel speaker so we can enjoy music while siting out on our balcony.  Until now, I've been using an Altec Lansing iM237, which has good sound and is reasonably portable.  But comparing the two side by side, the audio quality of the JBL is indistinguishable from the Altec Lansing, and it's less than half the size.  The speaker paired instantly with my iPad, and the Bluetooth range is amazing. It has a rechargeable battery, so that's one less replacement AAA battery I have to take, and it can be recharged from any standard 5V charger (the same one I take to recharge my iPad, iPhone, etc.). The JBL Micro Wireless is definitely my new favorite travel speaker - I can't recommend it more highly.",

When I opened the shipping box and saw this tiny little box inside, I immediately thought I had made a mistake. I had that sinking feeling that I had just been taken. The I turned it on and played music for the first time. WOW! I'm blown away over how so much high-quality sound could come from such a small package. Truly impressive. I called my wife and daughter into the room right away to show off my purchase, and have since ordered two more to give as gifts.The most impressive thing is the quality of the low-end. It loses some of its oomph when you listen to it outdoors around other ambient sound and no reflective surfaces, but so does every other audio product. I took it to a friend's pool party and everyone there who heard it was impressed, too. This little bugger will be great at the beach in a few weeks.It was easy to set up, has a simple button and dial for controls, and comes with a handy travel pouch. One thing I missed in the description and other reviews is that you can daisy-chain several speakers together to get even more sound. Great idea!The only thing I wish it had was a standard wall charger. Of course, you can plug the USB charger cord into any wall adapter and it works fine. I just know that will be the first thing I don't have when I need it.In all, a great product. Kudos, JBL!",

Now come on don't expect this to fill a house with sound but to let's say attach it to your bike, have it sitting next to you, or just fill a room with ambient music this guy fits the bill perfect. I mainly bought this for Fathers day for my self. See I got this BBQ Apron from a website called thinkgeek.com called the Tactical Apron (guys you have to check this out. Ladies your guy will love it) and I bought this speaker to fit into one of the pouches so I can listen to my music when moving around (inside/outside the house) without headphones and this works great. I find myself using this little speaker more than my other docks. When I move around in the house I just pick it up or hook it on my belt loop with a carabiner.",

    "reviewText": "I'll preface my remarks by saying this is merely my &#34;opinion,&#34; or perception.  Others may have very different reactions (apparently more positive ones), which will be affected by source material (vocals vs. instrumentals, guitar vs. piano, combo vs. symphony orchestra).I have yet to find a &#34;mini&#34; speaker that delivers the audio my ears require for listening to jazz and classical music.  (I'm so fastidious, I'll disqualify certain recordings from consideration on the basis of a recording engineer whose representation of the piano is always a distorted version of a &#34;real&#34; piano.I want &#34;real,&#34; full sounds, with &#34;true&#34; bass (not the artificially &#34;enhanced&#34; bass frequencies of the middle register.  I know there are speakers out their capable of passing my &#34;test&#34; (I begin with the bass of Paul Chambers on &#34;So What&#34; from Miles Davis' &#34;Kind of Blue&#34; and proceed from there to solo piano and then complete orchestra (from Bach to Bartok).  And I'm looking for a &#34;traveling&#34; unit that will slide as smoothly into my shoulder bag as an 11&#34; Mac Air (don't use a cover for maximum utiltiy and lightness).I'm a huge JBL / Harman-Kardon fan, and I had high hopes that this product would be a notable exception to all of the other frequency-challenger, underpowered &#34;mini&#34; speakers that I had tried (look for a few soon on Amazon).  Instead, the JBL Micro was too weak to satisfy even my wife (whose musical tastes are more broad than mine).I don't want to carry a &#34;box-shaped&#34; unit on trips much less up and down the stairs.  But I found one small unit that slipped into my bag and delivered enough sound to fill the house: the Motorola EQ7 (made by JBL).  It has not one but 4 transducers along with a heavy magnet and Blu Tooth, and its flat, &#34;omlet&#34; shape makes it fairly easy to slip into a should bag along with a laptop.  Unfortunately, the speaker has been discontinued now for 2-3 years, so an interested party needs to search for good used or refurbished units.My only caveats about the EQ7 (don't even give a 2nd look at the EQ5, which I also happen to have) is that stacking 4 AA batteries into it for portable use requires some practice and patience.  Also, the BluTooth can be a bit reluctant to &#34;pair,&#34; especially with equipment made after 2010.  Finally, after a couple of hourss, I definitely begin to feel its weight[---which must be twice as heavy as my computer.Consequently, I was quick to jump on to the comparable speaker not only manufactured by, but sold exclusively as, JBL itself.  It's the JBL On Tour iBT Bluetooth speaker which, like the EQ7, has a total of 4 transducers (2&#34; speakers) but is noticeably lighter and thinner ithan the EQ7.  The bass frequencies of the On Tour iBT are not as strong and clear as those of the EQ7, but the sound of a piano is as &#34;open,&#34; spacious and transparent, as the EQ7.  Although the user has to deal with the same &#34;battery problem&#34; and an extra button, the On Tour has become such a congenial &#34;travel partner&#34; that, when I saw that it too was being discontinued, I immediately purchased two more.  JBL would replace it with a subsequent speaker called &#34;The Flip,&#34; which I immediately had to return after hearing its distorted (to this pianist's ears) reproduction of the sound of a piano.  It's a great, dynamic company, and it can be hard to keep up with their constantly changing products (though their Harman Kardon Soundsticks have changed little since their first appearance 15 years ago (thankfully!). Regardless, the JBL name has always signified &#34;high quality&#34;--at least since I bought my first speaker from them in the early '70s (a bookshelf speaker with a 14&#34; woofer that I continue to use).Again, the above is merely one person's experience and opinion. For some reason, people tend to be especially passionate about their preferred speaker-even at extremely low price levels of under a hundred. I respect their opinions.  I've read glowing reviews of products that subsequently disappointed me.  But I never blamed the reviewer--unless it later became apparent that I had been misled by a paid hack's &#34;promo&#34; piece for the company's product.",

You can still plug it into the ear phone jack of a non Bluetooth device or connect to other speakers.When I was shopping Amazon had a good price on these.The one con: it has no stand for sitting it in a room to project out instead of up. It would be nice if it had a little flip out stand like a picture frame.Caution when purchase: Amazon sales both the plug JBL portable speaker that plugs into your device's ear phone jack and the wireless Bluetooth speaker.

But I bought a JBL Speaker myself after hearing it in a business meeting when we didn't have speakers available to play a training video.  I was shocked with the quality and volume this tiny speaker can deliver to a fairly large conference room. Impressed.I had seen all the advertising for the BEATS PILL so I bought one of those too (on black Friday deal for $149 at Staples) so I could compare side by side.The BEATS PILL gets the nod for clearer highs, but this little JBL holds it's own for the classic rock/pop music (at the volumes I enjoy) without the horrible distortion most small speakers put out at higher volumes!  It also delivers great bass response for it's size.It is truly light and absolutely acceptable to toss into my backpack when I'm traveling.  It has Bluetooth connectivity and works great with my iPhone 5s.The JBL speaker comes with an attached 3.5 connector which tucks nicely into a slot on the bottom of the speaker in case you need it.  No more carrying an extra cord with to make that connection - I use the cord to connect the speaker to my laptop as an external computer speaker.  It also has a port for input of a 3.5 connector on the side of the speaker - allowing you to &#34;chain&#34; speakers together for &#34;Stereo Sound&#34; (which I will be doing when I get my second one).WELL DESIGNED.  I really do LOVE it.NOTE: The BEATS Pill has extra features like speaker phone capabilities, but I really don't need that so back it goes.  Also it didn't automatically connect to my iPhone each time I turned it like the JBL did.  Another comment: BEATS PRODUCTS ARE WAY OVER PACKAGED! Makes it very luxurious looking when unpacking the item but I'm sure that's adds significantly to their cost.  You could almost drive a truck over the box their products come in - not environmental friendly!buy one or two.  you won't be disappointed!If you just want 5 hours per charge of very acceptable sound this JBL Micro wireless speaker is great!",

I really didn't expect much out of it, but was totally blown away with both the sound quality and the volume.  It sounded good right out of the box and the sound quality improved after several hours of listening.  My wife and I exercise several times a week in a large room. I set my iPhone to a pop dance station on Pandora and this speaker fills the room with good quality sound. The Bluetooth connection to my iPhone was flawless and the range is impressive.  This is a perfect travel speaker and we plan to use it extensively on an up-coming trip.At over 3\" in diameter it is a little bigger than I expected, but it comes with a soft carrying pouch and fits easily into a vest pocket. I have not tried linking it with another speaker, but getting a little separation with two speakers would most certainly improve the sound quality.It does not come with a wall plug for charging, just a short cord with a mini jack at the speaker end and a USB plug on the other.  However, I have charged it from the wall charging unit that came with the JBL Charge (the speaker jack is the same), I have charged it from the USB port on the Charge while listening to that speaker and from my computer.  I have also charged it by plugging it directly into simple USB power adapters for both 110V AC and 12V DC with no problem.  I have not maxed out the charge time on this speaker, but can vouch for at least 3 hours of continuous play.",

But its loud enough to fill rooms and turn heads. Nobody believes that this much sound can be emitted by this one tiny speaker.Pairing with devices is simple. Hold the power button. Wait for a double beep. and the speaker should pop up on your Bluetooth device list. Select it, wait for the single beep, and your good to go.The range of connectivity is good. I left my phone in my room, took the speaker outside for a smoke break and there was no distortion or static cracks. Although if something blocks either the phone or speaker directly, there will be some feed back.This thing looks great, sounds great, a bit pricy but if you settle for less your gonna regret it. I've had many mini speakers already. This has to top em all.The only things i dont like are that the volume is a wheel. Pretty old school. Also you cant change tracks from the speaker. You have to change songs through your device. Also the AUX cord is great and all(daisy chain, storage space, playability for Bluetooth-less devices) , but, the way it snaps into the bottom of the speaker doesnt allow the speaker to lay flat on a surface. When it comes to speakers, an even surface is necessary for best quality sound. They could easily fix this by making the rubber lip beneath the speaker slightly thicker. Another thing i noticed was that when you daisy chain it, so that larger speakers can become bluetooth enabled, there is some loss of sound. Not much, but i have equalizers set. I.d preffer to leave them that way rather than adjusting it here and there.Would i recommend this? Yes, but maybe you'd have more fun with the JBL Flip..",

This is amazingly loud and good quality given the size and mid-range price. If volume is your main concern, this is a very good option.The other concerns I had about this was bluetooth connectivity. It connected to an Acer laptop PC running Windows 8 with a super cheap ($4.95) bluetooth dongle, but it isn't always consistent or immediate. Sometimes we have to plug and unplug the dongle. Sometimes we have to put the computer to sleep and wake it up. Eventually, it has always connected, but at times there is a delay of 20-30 seconds. I don't place the blame for this on the speaker, but on the cheap dongle. That being said, my Mac Mini with built-in bluetooth running OS 10.6.8 could not find the device whether I was booted into Windows XP or into the Mac OS.  I know the Bluetooth on the Mac is functional because it has been able to tether to keyboards before. I'm not sure what the problem is, but if you are using an old Mac with an older OS, you may want to consider this as a potential problem.Since the speaker was purchased primarily to be used with the PC, I've been using the cable for use with the Mac. This works well, but I have serious concerns about repeated use of this short, very delicate cable which is tightly wound into the base of the speaker. It is so tight that if you don't wind it up precisely correctly, you can't fit the plug back into it's pre-formed spot in the base without stretching it a little. Given how delicate it is, I think that any sort of pull on the cable is likely to break the connection sooner rather than later. I've only had this for several weeks, so I can't say anything has gone wrong yet, but I'm considering buying a second cheap set of speakers to keep permanently connected to the Mac to put off this possible issue. I'd like to have a functional cable in reserve should the bluetooth fail and I don't want to waste this potential repeatedly connecting and disconnecting the cable. Because I feel like I have to buy another product to safeguard this one due to this design with the cable, I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased this product from another retailer & from the reviews I was hoping for the best.This was not it. First this was not loud enough at all. I paired it with my Samsung S2 & it seemed to be louder when I used the AUX compared to bluetooth. Honestly my speaker on my S2 was louder than the JBL Micro. I made sure the volume was up on both devises. Also at full volume there was a bit of distortion which no one likes. The battery lasted for about four hours before sounding worse as the battery got weaker. After that it completely stopped working with bluetooth & the wire. Another thing I didn't like but was convenient is the Aux wire is attached to the device. This is good to keep from loosing it but in time if the wire gets messed up (kink or tear) you are screwed because you can't replace it without replacing the whole unit.Bottom line I would not recommend this unless you don't like to hear your music.I also used this while I was in the yard & when about 12 to 15 feet away it was very hard to hear. I am sending this back & will be looking for a bluetooth speaker with more speakers & more watts. I will probably have to spend an extra $100. to get the quality I am looking for. In my experience 90% of the time you get what you payed for. I am considering the Jabra Soulmate,the Grace Digital ECOXGEAR or the Braven BRV-1. There are so many to choose from but spending $100. to $150. I should be happy.",

The volume of the iPhone is too weak to project bird calls/songs or tweets when trying to identify or call a bird to your area.  It works beautifully and has a clear, crisp sound and the bluetooth feature is a must.  I've used it several times now.  It sets up in seconds and you are ready to go. The small size allows you to put it in your pocket or attach it to a belt loop.  I'm careful not to use it in a populated nature walk area, especially if other birders are near and might be doing bird counts.  I also don't overplay it because I don't want to stress out the bird, just draw them close enough to identify with binoculars or get a photo.Good price and quality product.",

I say most because obviously the Jambox and other higher priced speakers have better bass and such, but way less portability. For this price range you can't beat the JBL Micro! It can fill up a whole room very well. I also love the hook on top because I can put a clasp on it and hang it from my belt loop when I'm going for a walk, it's like having a personal soundtrack. The battery also lasts a couple hours longer than they say but then again I usually play it at 50%-75% volume. It's great for camping and hiking. I also love the fact that you can daisychain multiple units together. My mom has one too and when you hook them both up the sound becomes even fuller as well as twice as loud. Charges fast and generally outshines ever other speaker in its class, hell I might get one for every belt loop!",

    "reviewText": "This is the 4th Bluetooth Speaker I've bought, and it buries the competition by a significant margin.  One of the earlier Bluetooth speakers I bought was the Cambridge Soundworks Oontz, which by comparison, falls way behind the JBL.  The Oontz almost completely lacks in any of the lower frequencies, and doesn't greatly impress me in the rest of the sound spectrum.  On the other hand the JBL Micro Wireless Bluetooth speaker has better bass, and overall, a much more realistic sound spectrum.  Almost all smaller speakers, one buys, are going to be a compromise in some area.  To have the desired portability, obviously you can't put a 12\" woofer in such a speaker, but what you can do is maximize the frequencies that a portable speaker system can produce.  JBL has done the best job so far.  No, it isn't stereo, but how much stereo affect can you expect from a speaker you can hold in the palm of your hand?  I read that one reviewer found that this speaker distorts.  Well, any speaker, driven too hard, will distort.  If you are driving a speaker that hard, you are in danger of blowing it's voice coil.  Obviously, it's unrealistic to expect a speaker, the cone of which is around 2\", to produce the level of sound of a bigger speaker.  Physics can tell you why that is, but common sense should also.  Within the reasonable realm of use, this speaker is, for now, the clear winner out of what I've experienced.  The battery charge life is very nice also.  JBL understates the expected duration of the battery charge life.  I got probably more than 7 hours at a very respectable sound level.  I also like the loop at the top of the speaker.  With the loop, I can put a carbiner on the speaker, and suspend it from a belt loop.  That enables me to carry it with me at work.  Lastly, pairing with my I-phone was a breeze.  Should I have trouble with any of my other Bluetooth devices, I'll amend my review.  If you are looking for a great little Bluetooth speaker, with a long charge life, this is a wise choice.  I can comfortably recommend it to anyone looking for a portable, Bluetooth speaker for their phone, or any other Bluetooth enabled audio device.  Don't waste your time, nor money on the competition; this is the one to get.***UPDATE***After owning my JBL Bluetooth speaker for more than a month, I'd be prepared to give it an even higher rating, were one available.  I'm still amazed, and was even fooled into believing someone was in an adjoining room, where I'd left it a few minutes before.  I'd forgotten that I'd left the speaker on, and thought someone was having a conversation on his phone.  That is the quality of sound that the JBL produces.  I also have to say that the charge capacity is even better than I initially reported.  With the volume turned all the way up, the speaker continued through the entire work day with charge left over  If someone knows of a Bluetooth speaker with greater quality sound, given it's size and cost, I'd very seriously ask that they send me a comment to that effect.  Finally,in my belief,  the JBL Micro Wireless Bluetooth speaker is, if not the best of it's kind, I have yet to find a better one.  You can buy this one, and know that it would be hard to do better.***Second Update*** After more than 2 months my enthusiasm for this speaker remains as high as ever.  I never cease to be amazed at it's charge life.  Used at full volume for nearly 8 continuous hours, the speaker's battery still has charge left.  I also have to agree with the others who praise the sound of the JBL Micro.  While the bass isn't going to blow you out of your seat, for a very small speaker I still want to know if someone finds one that is better, especially at a non-astronomical price point.  I'm sure there is one out there that sounds better, but is it as small, and is it's price as reasonable?  I'll believe it only if I see it.  Yes, IT IS THAT GOOD!***Third Update****  My enthusiasm, for this speaker, just continues to grow.  Last night, at work, my mp3's battery died on me causing me to have to plug it in to a charger.  I wanted to continue to listen, and thought I'd give the speaker an opportunity to show how far I could go without losing the pairing between it and the mp3 player.  At one point I was probably at least 75 feet away from the player, and the the speaker was locked on solid.  Mind you this was line of sight, but at the same time, the building I was in was a crazy source of Radio Frequency noise.  The range of a signal is a product of signal strength, distance, and other RF noise.  AS the distance increases the signal strength drops, and eventually it drops beneath the background noise.  The signal will keep on traveling infinitely, but will be of such a low strength that it will be completely overwhelmed by noise.  I digress.  The JBL Micro seems to have a robust bluetooth receiver in it, and is well capable of receiving a very respectable distance from the source.  This is just another reason to put it on the top of your list of possible choices for a bluetooth speaker.****Fourth Update****** It has now been more than a year since I bought my JBL, and it still keeps pleasing me.  Since buying it, I have purchased 2 other bluetooth speakers, neither of which will fulfill the role the JBL Micro does.  I'd say that the 2 biggest positives with the JBL Micro are the battery charge, and the overall sound.  Again, it doesn't have the most powerful base, but the overall sound spectrum is well balanced, and voices come out sounding very natural.  The only downside I can see with the JBL Micro is one common to all Bluetooth speakers I have so far seen, and that is that there is no provision for changing out the battery once it will no longer accept a charge.  That won't stop me from changing it, though, it will just make it harder.  Still, in the final analysis, even over the Bose Soundlink II Mini, I'll take the JBL Micro for most purposes.  Definitely, it is vastly more portable than the Bose, and far less likely to bother others around me than the Bose speaker.  I still recommend the JBL Micro to anyone wanting a great quality, affordable Bluetooth speaker.  Definitely it has been worth the money.",

All this time it has been in the dust bag on my desk and all the sudden, it decided to add some &#34;extra sounds&#34; to the music I am playing.  I am so disappointed at the quality of the speaker.

    "reviewText": "Why give a Bluetooth speaker 5 stars if it doesn't sound awesome? Basically it has redeeming qualities that helped me overlook some of it's shortcomings. Initially I felt that it was slightly overpriced, but after having it for a couple weeks I feel that the overall quality you get made it worth the price.Design:It's classy with its modern retro black and silver color scheme. It's lightweight, and shaped like a hockey puck.  So not only is it small but it's travel friendly, since it's flat and round it can easily be carried in a backpack, jacket or even a pocket without being too blocky or being that awkward bulge.  It also has a built in loop to hang it or clip onto a ring.  It's got an aux input/ output or you can use the built in a 3.5mm wire that tucks away.  One thing I would rather have is a volume rocker instead of a dial, because of less chances of changing volume or breaking on contact.Performance:Quite good it pairs quickly, has good range, charges fast, and lasts longer than 5 hoursSound:It's definitely loud for it's size, has good mids, clear highs, and OK bass.  The mono speaker has a potential disadvantage to stereo devices. If your using it with a mobile device one thing to try, is to install an equalizer app to add a bit more bass or punch. I noticed that it sounded better connected to my phone than my tablet, but with the app it gave the tablet audio a slightly fuller sound.So if you're looking for the best sounding Bluetooth speaker in this price range, you might want to consider looking at alternatives.  However, if your looking for a Bluetooth speaker that is portable, small, lightweight, good sound, and has a unique design that stands apart from the typical bricks and cubes then the JBL Micro wireless is a great choice to consider.",

That fact alone means I use this speaker more than anything other audio equipment I have.  There is just enough base to balance out the sound and give it enough timbre to make it sound natural (not tinny).  I use it for music and talk radio with no gripes.  It can be heard from quite a long distance.  As to Bluetooth ability, I've been on the 2nd floor of my house with it on the 1st floor (multiple walls of separation) and opposite side of the house and the connection is uninterrupted.  The charge lasts in the 7-10 hour range (depending on volume) and it recharges in about an hour.  The analog volume dial is a nice return to what had always worked best - - you can kill the sound (or lower it) instantly and change it in the slightest of increments. The tether hook at the top is sort of interesting, I've worn it around my neck with a lanyard like a reincarnation of Public Enemy a couple times, but the bouncing against my stomach/chest got annoying.  Any interesting note I haven't heard anyone point out is that since this is so small and has an audio out jack, you can use it as a Bluetooth beacon for your stereo or other equipment that has a micro-jack input, making it &#34;Bluetooth capable&#34; as well.  While you could do this with other speakers, the small size of this one makes it such that it can be completely hidden or otherwise neatly tucked away.  Enjoy!",

My ma can leave it on the desk and take her phone with her in her pocket and come back without it disconnecting, and hearing the music nice and loud while moving around her office space, and I can leave my phone in my bedroom and bring this speaker into the bathroom and leave it outside the shower (I hang the speaker up by its clip by a hook for bathrobes, this makes the sound project all through the room).

The size is perfect; it can fit in a jacket pocket or backpack side pouch without looking too awkward. The bluetooth connectivity is quick and simple. The battery lasts for hours of playback and charges via a microUSB. Perfect since most folks have dozens of these cords already. Most importantly, the sound quality is outstanding! Compared to the Philips \"grenade\" speaker (which I also own), the highs and lows are just slightly more crisp, and it packs a little bit more punch.But the JBL included features that I did  not expect. It can be hooked up to a standard audio jack using the hardwired aux input cord. And that same cord can be used as an audio-out as well. So you use bluetooth to connect your phone to the JBL, and you can plug the JBL into any audio device (car, stereo, home theater, etc) to turn it into a bluetooth bridge/receiver. Completely unexpected!Overall the quality and functionality of this unit is well with the price. A+ would buy again.",

For instance, when cooking in the kitchen with the dishwasher going the, iHome can not be distinctly heard above the dishwasher noise, while the JBL Micro Wireless rises above the noise admirably. You also don't have to be sitting or standing close to it to hear it well like I had to with the iHome model. The JBL Micro Wireless can be heard a couple rooms away as well. Decent bass for watching movies or listening to music (Important to me because I am hearing impaired).But--bought Aug 16, 2013 and now today Dec 18, 2013 just received an RMA for returning the JBL. Will not pair with any of my blue-tooth devices. Have fingers crossed that the replacement will last longer.FYI if you need to return/replace your JBL Micro Wireless, there is a return/replacement form on the JBL site that can be filled out and processed online. If you haven't yet registered your speaker, you'll need to do this first before requesting an RMA.I had to call to make sure the return request had been processed a week later, it had not and the rep processed it for me and emailed me an RMA#. Advise you do the same and call if you don't hear back within a week.",

I dint look at the specifications of the speaker before it arrived but really expected something comparable to a 6.5&#34; speaker. To my surprise when it arrived the thing looked to be about a 2&#34; speaker. I was immediately worried that I was going to have something barely better than the speaker on my phone. After a short charge (about an hour) I paired up (very easy) and launched Spotify. At first I didn't hear anything because the speaker was turned all the way down, once I figured that out I eased the volume up on my phone and was quite amazed by the volume of the sound that this little speaker was putting out, and also how clear it was. Sure the bass is not going to be felt in your chest but it does pump out an incredible amount of bass for something so small. I love it!I am using an HTC Amaze Android powered cell phone mostly. I also pair up my Nexus 7. Both devices pair within seconds once the speaker is turned on and sound great (much better than the built in speakers, the JBL has depth).",

    "reviewText": "Setup was a breeze.  The first time I powered on the device it automatically went into pairing mode, just found it on the iPhone hit it and it connected and started playing music through it immediately without any further action required on my part.  There is only one button that is pressed to power it on and off or held to put the speaker back into pairing mode to pair it to a different device.  There is also a single multipurpose light that tells you when the device is in pairing mode, powered on, charging, or needs charged. There is also a built in cord that will allow you to plug the speaker into anything with a headphone jack to use it with devices that don't support music playback via Bluetooth.I have mostly been keeping it charged so can't speak at all about battery life yet but it has lasted the couple hours here or there when I used it off a charger.Alright after a few days of tinkering around with this and testing out all of it's capabilities I feel like I have a solid enough feel for this little speaker to give some insight.  The main thing you have to consider is your purchasing a lightweight highly portable speaker and this isn't going to offer the best sound quality in the world.  I'm not an audiophile but I do spend a fair share of time listening to music in various setups.  The sound on this thing is average in general but incredible for a speaker this size.First and foremost is the lows.  To me lows are a big big part of music and something that the average listener may even miss out on until the hear a system with incredible bass.  The lows on this device are in general fairly crisp and clear but underwhelming to say the least.  I have noticed a few songs where low beats I'm used to hearing in my car system just aren't replicated.  This is to be expected on a speaker this size so it's not a complaint just something to keep in mind.  My main complaint and the only real reason I deducted a star is I noticed that on some rock songs with deep string bass the speaker rattles and distorts at high volume.  It's not every song but it's just enough of an annoyance to me to deduct a star.The mids and highs will go together because I have essentially the same thing to say about them.  They are both very very clear and sound just as good as they do on some of my more expensive audio solutions.  Voices are very clear and on point and everything in the mid and high range on this speaker comes out sounding amazing.The volume is adequate considering this is a small speaker that I am mostly using to clip onto a belt loop when doing work out in the yard or around the house to be able to enjoy my music with a good quality sound without having to wear cumbersome heavy headphones.One surprising feature that I thoroughly enjoyed is the aux out option.  This has allowed me to plug this speaker into my sound system at home with a cable like this http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-3-5mm-Male-2-Male-Adapter/dp/B004YEBK66/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1390194162&sr;=8-2&keywords;=rca+to+aux and play all my bluetooth music through my sound system.  All you have to do is turn the volume wheel on the speaker all the way down and plug it in and it will play strictly through the sound system.  I love this option and am greatly surprised this as able to pull it off.  I even have a USB port on my sound system to plug this into and keep it charged while it plays.All in all the best speaker you will be able to find in this price and size range.",

For the price, it seemed the sound was a touch muddy, the volume a bit low, and the physical weight a little heavy.So I began looking for a lighter, equal-or-better sounding alternative. After some online research and a few visits to local electronics stores, I found the JBL Micro Wireless. At $60 it was affordable, it was lightweight, and the volume and clarity exceeded what I was getting with my Jambox.Pros:* Very light and compact. Easy to toss in a backpack or jacket pocket* Great sound clarity. JBL's writeup emphasizes the bass response (because the world has been trained to equate thumpy bass with sound quality), but while the bass is solid for such a small box, the real win is that this tiny speaker produces a clean, precise sound even at relatively high volumes. Audiophile? No. Great for the money and convenience? Yes!* Volume dial lets you lock in a sound level even when turning the speaker on and off* Simple and solid. Just the two controls you need: power and volumeCons:* Not stereo. But that's a tradeoff I can live with for the convenience* Clip loop is a bit awkward. I thought I might hang it off a picture hook on my office wall, but the size and position of the loop requires a fairly lengthy (3/4 inch or so) hook length.",

And the cord tucks away easily and cleanly. I also like that the volume adjustment is a dial, not buttons.

I compared them by using 2 iphone 5 connected to the same song on youtube and played them at the same time. After fading the volume up and down on each speaker it is clear that even though the HMDX Jam is a little louder the JBL definitely a clearer and cleaner sound. I use this outside while working construction. All my coworkers are amazed at the big sound coming from this little speaker. It says it will last 5 hours but I have been using it most of the day on my 10 hour shift and I have not had it die on me yet. Maybe because we don't always play it at full volume. I love it!!!",

I cranked this puppy all the way up, and it didn't distort at all. It fills the room with sound that's crisp and clear. It didn't cut out or anything with the bluetooth, and I listened for a while. Plays excellently with Pandora as well. Got a free bass boost for my Android phone, and it even made the bass better.Walked all over my apartment, and it didn't lose the signal at all.The other thing that's great is that it's so tiny and lightweight. I can take it anywhere.I chose this, because JBL has such a good reputation, and they're known for making speakers.Very happy with my purchase.",

    "reviewText": "First, the sound is better than expected.  Granted I had relatively low expectations considering the size and the reported build quality.  Well, I'm impressed on all fronts.For its size, price, and features, I can definitively say that the fidelity is very good and the speaker itself of decent build.  It's fairly dense and has some heft to it; this to maximize the low end response in a very small frame.  The default balance between high and low is pretty good as well.  The bluetooth range from my iPhone5 is about 30-35ft without obstruction.  I greatly appreciate the fact that it can operate while charging.  Sorry, I haven't thoroughly tested battery life yet.I'm certainly not implying it can go head-to-head with even low priced amplified speaker sets.  IMO, it does however match or exceed comparably priced portable speakers, pound for pound.  So far I'm happy with the purchase.",

    "reviewText": "This bluetooth speaker can hold its own.  We recently went to a packed beach on Memorial Weekend and we can clearly hear the music from this speaker even though there were others playing their music.  One of my friend who brought his speaker had to shut his off since this JBL speaker was a lot louder than his.I read a lot of reviews for bluetooth speakers of this size and I purchased this speaker for its clarity and ability to be played at a loud volume.  This JBL speaker has certainly met those qualities.  The sound is very clear and it can be played to the max volume without any distortion.  The other item to note about this speaker is the old school volume knob/adjuster, some people might find this not so appealing, but I actually like this better than a press button type of adjuster.  The volume level stays on the setting you last set it rather than re-adjusting to 50% of the volume like some devices that have the press button adjuster or some kind of digital adjuster.The only con about this speaker is the price.  To me it's a little bit on the expensive side for its size but I guess you get what you pay for.",
