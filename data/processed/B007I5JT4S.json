I have IPods, an iPad 2, a 2012 Mac Mini, and now Apple TV (newest version). It's been well stated that there is not a lot available for content outside of the Apple Eco System as compared to Roku, for example.I've hardwired the ethernet connection to my router from the Apple TV, as suggested, to avoid overloading my wireless capability at home.I'm running the latest version of the OS on the Apple TV, Mirroring my Mountain Lion and Ipad screens is very handy.I've updated my review and added a 4th star because the 'wired ethernet causing content load failure' issue has been addressed. The device needs to have more content available and have it available from the Itunes store. That's the only drawback at this point that I see, and it costs 1 star...I have seen one 'bug' in the current version of the software. Loading select Vimeo content caused an error message stating that the content wouldn't load because my TV didn't support the 'HDMC' protocol (an encryption protocol used by newer HDMI devices). Recommended fix was replugging my Apple TV into the TV. That didn't work. Cold booting the Apple TV did fix the issue.As others have stated, this is a no brainer if you already have Apple products, especially newer ones. If you don't have Apple products, then unfortunately at this time, I could not recommend this product to you, it simply wouldn't have the value per the cost to you... That's the bottom line.",

Also - now so many apps that navigating is a pain. They should give option to put apps in a &#34;not used&#34; folder. 98% of what we do is Netflix.Still - overall - we love it.One great thing - go to Apple Maps on the iPad (or iPhone) - go to flyover - and send it to your big screen.

Then again, the item is a STREAMING Device. So that is Apparently not what it is suppose to doThe Pre-Set options that comes with this unit is VERY Limited. beside home sharing of the content on the Apple Products or the Purchases from ITunes, it only offers YouTube, Hulu and Netflix for streaming contents right off the internet. the search in youtube is easy and simple, but it lack the option to Sort or Refine the results with any criteria or catagory. at least I have not been able to locate the option to do so as of yet.",

    "reviewText": "After researching the differences between the Apple TV and Roku, I grabbed the top end Roku for a great price one of the times it was offered on Woot because it offers more services and was less expensive than the Apple TV. I never did hook it up, always next weekend's project, although the hookup is ridiculously easy. I never could get the Apple TV out of my head. Yes, it offers less services than Roku but as with all or most Apple products, the ease of use and seamless integration with other Apple devices can't be beat. I hooked up the Apple TV the day I got it. Just FYI, if you go through an HDMI switch you can't get sound without a toslink digital audio cable, at least I couldn't. No problem, I bought a toslink 1:3 switch on Amazon a while back so connecting the Apple TV with HDMI for video and toslink for audio was a breeze. Using Air Play in Mountain Lion and iOS 5 and 6 (Macbook Pro and Air, iPad 3rd gen, and iPnone 5 respectively) was just as seamless as advertised. There is a bit of lag but that's to be expected in Central Florida with the broadband traffic. Even with the slight lag, the ability to stream video and audio so easily is terrific. My iTunes Match music showed up almost immediately on my Samsung HD TV and in another couple of seconds the music started playing through my theater system. I inevitably have to bring work home so seeing my desktop on the big TV screen is a nice alternative, especially when I'm using my 11\" MAcbook Air.Because I haven't hooked up the Roku, i can't say how its video and audio compare. Of course it doesn't do Air Play so there is no streaming from Apple devices to the TV.So why the 4 stars for the Apple TV? Even with my small hands, using the remote is frustrating. It's just so small that I'm forever pressing it incorrectly, causing delays when trying to navigate or type in passwords etc. I actually have to press it with my nail instead of the pad of my finger in order to be accurate. Also, the display on the Macbooks becomes so tiny when using Air Play that I can barely see it, although there's probably a way to adjust this other than by increasing the magnification manually.All in all, I don't regret my purchase. I'm not reinventing the wheel when I say that if you have a lot of Apple stuff, the Apple TV is the way to go. If not, the Roku may be the better choice.",

Any Mac or PC in the house, running iTunes, will automatically show up and stream to your TV.Yes, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation and other devices can do some or all of the above features, and if you have one of those, you probably don't need this. But the AppleTV is the simplest solution of them all. If you want something that a babysitter can figure out immediately without a lengthy training session, or something you can put in a guest room for company, or a way for your small children to watch their favorite cartoons over and over again, this is the way to go.",

I'm reserving one star for when Hulu+ and an AppleTV app store appears. I was a HUGE fan of Walmart's VUDU service because of the streaming quality. VUDU, HBO GO and Hulu+ are all built into my Samsung Smart TV and I could get by without the Apple TV. But, I can afford to have an Apple TV in every room with an HDMI TV.If you have no Macs or iOS devices the cheapest Roku will do the job. But this AppleTV with 1080p is way more fun to use with my iPad 3, iPhone 4S, and MacBookPro. Sky Gamblers Air Supremacy is awesome and the Apple TV is small enough to take on trips.",

Also there are a. world of TV series that are available from the first episode on. .The deciding factor in my selecting Apple TV over the latest Roku is the mirroring of the iPad (2 or later) screen onto the large screen TV. There were things that I could only watch on my computer that is a lot more enjoyable on the big screen TV.The remote is small but very good. I have had an older Roku for some time. The newer one also has 1080 hd capability and seems to sell for the same price. It might boil down to the mirroring.  No matter which one is right for you -- jump on it.

    "reviewText": "Apple TV 3 is much improved comparing to the Apple TV 2 that I own also. The 1080p versus 720p in Apple TV 2 is the most recognized advantage in all reviews. But beside that, it has newer processor and works much faster. The Wi-Fi connection is more stable in my opinion. Setup is fast and easy, identical to the one on Apple TV 2. The menu is quite intuitive and does not requires to search pages through user guide to find the function. Connection to iTunes account was easy and worked instantly after entering my account info.The only con i could find is it haven't been jailbroken yet, so not able to install XBMC on this. But it is probably just the matter of time.Overall, it is the great product.",

    "reviewText": "Apple TV has made my cord cutting experience tolerable.  I grew tired of increasing cable TV prices and having difficulty finding TV programming that I actually wanted to watch. I truly believe TV media is changing as we know it.  Apple TV and other streaming media devices are leading this change.PROS:- Airplay is awesome.- Did I mention that Airplay is awesome?- No really, Airplay is what sets apart Apple TV from all its competitors and really an amazing feature.  I digress...- I personally enjoy the following options on Apple TV:  YouTube, Apple Radio, iTunes via Airplay, Bloomberg News (surprisingly), Yahoo Screen (for SNL and The Onion), PBS, ESPN and NBA (for game highlights and short news clips) , Crackle, The Weather Channel, VEVO, Podcasts (which I never used before), and the Airplay Mirroring feature (mostly for Basic Hulu).- I can usually find something on Apple TV to occupy my time.  After all,  isn't that what TV is for?  It does take some effort to find something sometimes.  It's not like regular TV where you can just turn it on and all your programming is done for you.INTRIGUING OFFERS IF I FELT LIKE SPENDING MORE MONEY OR BEING MORE TECH SAVY:-Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO GO-iMovie, Photos/Videos, FlickrCONS:- no amazon prime offering (however I think I read you can mirror Amazon Prime with an iOS device)- the remote works well however could be improved with a keyboard feature or headphone jack or sensor technology- no gaming features unless you use an iPad or iPhone with Mirroring- Mirroring did not work well straight out of the box (I had to alter my router settings to get rid of very jerky video playback.  This took me a while to figure out as no Apple representatives were able to help me.  I found the fix on some random messaging board.)- Video playback of HD quality video with mirroring is still slightly jerky.  Let me stress that the playback is only SLIGHTLY jerky.  It's to the point where its hardly noticeable to me.  It does not bother me, but it's not perfect.  My understanding is because it takes a lot of bandwidth to mirror from your device to the Apple TV.  I do not know that there is any way to completely fix this without running a cord.  Video playback used to be flawless using my HD cable. Despite all this, I value being able to mirror with Airplay more than running my HD cable.- not as much channel availability as the ROKU.  I have never used the ROKU, but I've heard that quality ROKU channels are few and far between despite their large channel lineup.WARNING:DON\"T FORGET TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN OPERATING SYSTEM ON YOUR APPLE DEVICE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE APPLE TV AIRPLAY FEATURE!BOTTOM LINE:If you are an Apple user already, I recommend the Apple TV.  If not, I think the ROKU is a fine option.  Apple TV and ROKU are especially valuable if you wish to \"cut the cord\" to Cable TV.MY TWO CENTS FOR THOSE \"CUTTING THE CORD\":Don't forget to use a quality TV antenna for those days when you cannot find something on your streaming media player.  TV via the antenna has come along way.",

Like at this moment, I was trying to decide if I wanted the new xbox one or the PS4. Then, I thought, I have an Apple TV that is just amazing. It runs fast, no delays, very responsive. Remote is very little, not another big remote that usually comes with a tv or cable box. Netflix is in HD, everything is in HD. It had a recent update that made it even better. Has numerous of apps. Netflix, HULU Plus, WWE TV, NBA TV, ABC TV, HBO GO and Crackle. I can go on and on about everything the APPLE TV has but, back to what I was saying. Xbox one, has all the entertainment features and gaming. Why pay an extra $100 for a product, that I had already paid $100 for that does everything that I need entertainment wise. So, I decided I'm going to eventually get the PS4. Now, enough about my xbox one or ps4 decision. The product is great. It's small, almost to the point that it's about as long as a credit card for it's width and height and the depth of it, is easily only about 3 inches. It won't take much room at all. The remote is small and is great. The added feature though, is if you're like myself and own numerous apple products already. The Apple TV let's you airplay anything that you see on your phone to your tv including pictures, videos, music, apps, messages. Anything. The other cool thing abut this product that I love so much is the fact that you can get the remote app for free in the apple store on your iPhone and use your iPhone as a remote for it. Instead of dealing with an extra remote, you can just leave the remote app running and always have your remote and it's free of buttons, so you just roll your fingers anywhere you want your apple tv to go when selected a product. That concludes why I love this product and why I give it a 5 out of 5 star rating. I would for sure recommend it to a friend and, I would just give them all the run downs and how they wouldn't regret making the awesome purchase.",

Wireless to my computer and iTunes, so no problem with running wires.  I did have a problem with the screen saver stopping after 30 minutes, then having to restart the Apple TV before it would connect to the PC again.  I downloaded the latest software and there must have been a fix in there because it hasn't done it since.All you do for the screen saver of your photos is make a folder on your computer and then point your iTunes to it via the iTunes software.  The screensaver can do various effects to bring photos in and out.  Very nice for family photos or vacation photos when you have people over.",

It provides 1080p FHD HDMI output and Dolby Digital sound quality. Rather a slideshow or PowerPoint presentation for work or just music and movies as I do, it's a great product.

You can access many different non-apple accounts from; the NHL network to Vimeo and from youtube to Netflix. Also, you have the same access to the iTunes store that you would from a computer (albeit in a different interface). The real great thing about appleTV is that you can &#34;mirror&#34; your macbook and iphone to your television - this basically means that you can watch your computer screen on your TV. This only works if you have the iPhone 5 (or newer) and a 2011 or newer macbook pro - I'm not sure about other apple products, so please read the fine print before buying! Also, with slightly older apple technology (say iPhone 4) you will still be able to use airplay to play music and videos.However, I feel that apple is still lacking in the total user interface with appleTV. As of April 2013, they do not have access to an app store, so what you see on the main screen is what you get.",

    "reviewText": "Apple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION]I wanted the Apple TV so I could access recorded shows from my DVR onto another TV.  I wanted it to be able to access my DVR and transfer live TV to my other TV.  After I bought it, I read some discouraging reviews stating that Apple TV can not stream HBO GO or others.  The Apple TV DOES enable me to stream HBO GO in full screen mode using AirPlay and not by mirroring.  I access NPR music and PBS apps on my Ipad, and play the concerts and shows on full screen ( a 42 inch LG and a 55 inch LG led 3D tv.) I do the same with HBO GO too.  All of these work on Ipad 2 and 4 and Ipod Touch 4. The clarity of the picture is incredible, better than the Roku -- which is pretty good and beats most built in smart apps included with newer DVR's and \"smart\" TV's.I use DishAnywhere on my Ipad and can access all the live TV channels I subscribe to including any and all in either HD or SD.  I can access ShowTime and HBO as well as NBC or Comedy Central.  I access DishOnDemand and watch the shows on my large TV from the Ipad.  I am also able to access my stored shows and movies from the DVR and play them on the Ipad and then via Apple TV view and listen to them on the large screen TV in full HD quality.  I am not using 'mirroring.'Note: My Apple Ipad 2 does not allow me to access Dish Anywhere except only by \"mirroring.\" That is not as good of an option since I cannot get the entire TV screen filled this way.  Also, regardless of which device I use, the Amazon app for the Ipad ( or Ipod Touch) will only broadcast the sound not the picture, so I would have to use mirroring for that app, but I have had a Roku 2XS, and I use that for Amazon Video streaming to access my Prime movies and others.The video quality on the Apple TV is brighter and appears to offer more definition and clarity than the Roku --- which, again provides an excellent picture.  I do not use Netflix but my wife is trying a one month sub only to get Blu Ray DVD's of a certain TV series. The Netflix app on the Apple TV is by far the best HD quality picture one can get.  The You Tube app is excellent since I can also use my paired Blue Tooth keyboard to search the Your Tube site.  The WSJ site is good too.  I am taken aback as to how much I can stream in HD from my Ipod Touch 4. I am using the Ipod over the Ipad to access the apps and DishAnywhere.Of course I can access the my iTunes library but I don't care to listen to the music on my TV.  I have a few movies in my library that I acquired via ultra violet or something like that which I have in my iTunes cloud. Playing them back from ?wherever they are via the Apple TV is a real pleasure. The color and picture quality are the best.  Apple still reigns supreme when it comes to producing a great visual and sound product.",

My built-in Samsung smart TV's web browsers three times faster than Google TVs chrome browser with their Logitech review.. So I bought the Apple TV. Love it the remote is very cool wafer thin the box is nice and Compact.. First of all YouTube has zero problems buffering and streaming Unlike some of the other devices I have tried with YouTube.. including Google TV!! And the newest model has Hulu. The navigation menus are very user-friendly to navigate. Netflix YouTube and Hulu it works great. Also if u have a iPhone you can download the remote control and link it to your AppleTV so when you type you don't have to scroll using the remote to type each painstaking letter one by one.. If you already own any other type of Apple device then this is a must for you to get!! You won't be sorry!! I'm just sorry that I didn't get this thing in the first place when I considered it Months ago..",

Because I already had that cable, I wasn't sure if buying an Apple TV was going to be any improvement for me. I'm glad I took the chance.  Now I can do Airplay mirroring all wirelessly!  I can easily share photos and videos from my iPhone/iPad on my TV without needing to stand nearby for the wire.  I am a Netflix customer and another great benefit is being able to access the on demand Netflix movies right from Apple TV.  The Netflix interface is beautifully designed and easy to use.  I also like the fact that the Apple TV will automatically power down after a period of inactivity, so you can leave it plugged in all the time.  The only thing I didn't like about the Apple TV is that when you have to type something such as your Netflix login, you have to navigate an on-screen keyboard with the Apple TV remote, which is not very easy.",

    "reviewText": "Being an devout Apple product purchaser and user, I never really had the desire to use or purchase an Apple TV (aTV). But just last week, my family \"Cut The Cord\" from our Dish Network, picked up Hulu and Netflix and have enjoyed the results. Partly because the aTV offers us the freedom of having all the services we have come to enjoy in such an easy device, but also this device isn't static. Clean interface and extremely easy setup, the aTV offers the ability for my family to use it anywhere (given there is an internet connection).Pros:-The Apple Tv is clean. Being slightly bigger than a hockey puck and almost as thin, this little device can be placed virtually anywhere.-With more than one service (Now) currently available, the device makes it really nice to watch different content without having to pay the large price tag that comes with cable.-With Netflix, Hulu, MLB, NBA, NHL, iTunes, Vimeo and many more available, the hours that have been spent and will be spent are going to be countless.-1080p content on the Apple TV is visually Astounding. Even at 720p, the graphics and display of the aTV making watching TV more enjoyable with crisp, clean graphics.-User interface is extremely simple. With navigation of the device with the Apple Remote (which comes with the device) or the Remote App for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, makes traversing the content and options easy and quite simple compared to the Roku  or Netgear Neo.Con: (Yes there are a few)-Unlike many other services (Xbox Live, Playstation Network, Roku, Netgear Neo, Boxee), Apple TV doesn't offer other options such as Crackle, Voodu, Ultraviolet, or other services. If Apple hasn't released it in an update, it's not there.-Although much of the content can be accessed via Netflix and other services, not being able to access downloaded movies from Amazon or even your external HardDrive is a huge Con especially if your not limited to just one service provider for content.-iTunes is great for movies, music and tv shows, but there are many networks that allow these to be streamed for free over the internet. The Apple Tv doesn't allow for any connection to them (Unless your willing to break your warranty by Jailbreaking (unsuggested)).-There is no music services like Pandora, Last.Fm, or Spotify available.-HDMI is the only connection and is not supplied with the device.Overall:If you are looking for a great media streamer, with NetFlix, Hulu, many sports and the ability to watch previous movies/shows that have been purchased or downloaded with iTunes. Then Apple TV is right for you. Unlike many of the other media streamers, the interface and controls are much smoother and the experience is more enjoyable. If you have ever used or owned an Apple Product, the same quality that is used to make those products is used here with the Apple TV.I have tried and used many other of the media players and can say that you get what you pay for. $100 is seems like nothing when you don't pay $100's of dollars a year for cable/Dish services.",

Because Apple doesn't support Adobe Flash, many video's I've watched on my laptop are not viewable on AppleTv. But I knew that when I purchased, just didn't realize the extent of how much on YouTube uses Adobe Flash Player. So video's are limited.I'm still a novice and learning as far as my AppleTv goes, but it seems that to be able to play my purchased iTunes from my iPhone and iPad, it seems I have to subscribe to iTunes Match to be able to do so? This is at a cost of $25 annually. I was under the impression I'd be able to listen to these like on my other Apple products.The remote is VERY flimsy. I have large hands and when using, I can feel the the thin body of the remote flexing when using.I have doubts about the lifespan of the remote.The Radio app is great though. I listen to hard rock and heavy metal mostly, and there are endless channel's to listen too. Every sub-genre of metal is covered. And International channels too! Excellent!Overall, pretty good device but not great. As I get more familiar with it, maybe my opinion will improve as far as my rating goes. Especially if I don't have to subscribe to another Apple product to listen to my iTunes on my tv. And please Apple, make a more robust remote!!!!",

The bottom line:Apple TV - Of course it is intuitive and easy to set up.  Works like a charm --- and oh my, what stellar build quality compared to the competition.  Pros: Netflix works great, Airplay is awesome, Ethernet port is HUGE, and the digital audio output is so important depending on your setup.  Cons: No Amazon (no sh#t I understand why...but still a big issue given I'm an Amazon Prime member), who cares about NBA and MLB??  However, the lack of Amazon (for my dollar) makes the difference between buying 3 Apple TVs or 1 Apple TV & 2 Rokus.Roku 2 XD - Very nice interface and easy to set up.  Works like a charm -- but don't drop it or hit it against anything as it is likely to break easily (very, very flimsy build).  Pros - Amazon and other content.  Cons - No Airplay, no Ethernet, and no digital audio output.",

I'm bumping this up to four stars but I'm leaving my original comments online so that people can see that this product has historically not gotten the support it needs from Apple.Original Review: 2 Stars:Considering the Apple name and the price, I expect a premium product - this doesn't cut it.  Hulu Plus only works if the device is set to Wifi, even after a firmware update.  This is a known issue that Apple can't or won't straighten out with Hulu.  I can cope because the wireless streaming is reasonably fast and reliable ... BUT .... tonight I rent a movie on iTunes and it won't load unless I hard-wire the internet.  Tedious.If you're expecting the same quality you find in iPhones and MacBooks, then no, this isn't the same level of quality usually found in Apple products.  I expect to tinker with cheap, also-ran products but not slick, expensive Apple products.  Just under the surface is a 5-star product waiting to bust out here, but this device is the red-headed step-child of the Apple line.  It's basically a beta-test for the TV Apple is going to make anyway, and it feels like it.",

Setup was very easy and adding photos through iPhoto worked great.

Seems logical route, buy an apple product from amazon to watch amazon on an apple.

    "reviewText": "First off, if you own multiple Apple products such as iPhone, iPad and etc, this is the perfect compliment to your i products. The airplay works great and you can stream music / photos and video to your TV (even though at a compressed format for high quality videos). It's a great way to share media with friends and family at home.If you are getting a streaming box to watch movies from the internet such as Hulu and Netflix, this is also the device to get. I think it has the most user-friendly interface out there for the most popular apps (but the lack of back button on the remote was confusing initially). Unfortunately, it doesn't have the Amazon Instant Video app, so it might be a deal breaker if you are a Amazon Prime user. Everything you buys from iTunes is also available to stream from Apple TV. And it also streams everything you have on your iTunes library.The only people I would not recommend to get this are the PC users looking to stream stuffs from their PC without going through iTunes. Since iTunes does not play a lot of video format that are popular on PC such as MKV, AVI, WMV, you would need to convert your video library to iTunes compatible format e.g. mp4. It may not be your best use of time. Some people had success jailbreaking an older generation of Apple TV that allows them to stream media without iTunes but as of the date of this review, it does not look like this Apple TV is jailbreakable. I would recommend getting the Roku 2 XD or XS for such users. They are available at Amazon at similar, if not lower, price.So if you are invested in iTunes and Apple hardware, definitely get this. If not, look for alternatives mentioned.",

Not only does she finally have Netflix access on the TV, but that Airplay...wow!  Anything from you ipad, ipod, iphone, macbook, imac.... all can stream straight to your tv!  No delay or anything!Wanna hear your playlist while cleaning a room on the opposite side of the house from your computer? No problem, stream it!Tired of playing the Sims on that small macbook screen? No problem, mirror your desktop on the 40&#34; TV!I would've given it 5 stars if.... well you know what, I can't think of anything so it gets the 5!  The only gripe I WOULD have is that the Airplay doesn't work with any OS before Lion, and I haven't upgraded and don't want to.. but hey, it's not for me and all her computers are fully upgraded! She loves it.  This gift was so good, I could probably skip a year or two of presents haha.",

    "reviewText": "Great little box!  One word:  AirPlay!  If you have an iPhone or iPad, it is worth it solely for this feature.  You can 'mirror' what is on your display, and also stream audio/video via AirPlay.I have two of these at home, one is connected to my 50 inch plasma for video/streaming.  Mostly Hulu/Netflix/YouTube.Another is in a different room connected via HDMI to my AV Receiver for audio only.  I listen to music and podcasts on this one.  Apps that support AirPlay that I have used and work (there are probably lots more than this):  Downcast, Pandora, Spotify, built in Music app, NPR News, NPR Music, TuneIn Radio, and Amazon Cloud Player.PROS:--AirPlay, AirPlay, AirPlay!--Great Netflix/Hulu interfaces--YouTube (go to \"most watched\" today or this week to see the latest viral videos)--1080p video looks fantastic--More content available with the latest software update (v5.3), including HBOGO, WatchESPN, and Sky News.--Draws less than 1 watt of power for the 3rd gen, rev2 model -- A1469.  This is according to an analysis done by AnandTech in March 2013--Small:  about the size of a hockey puck!  Speaking of hockey pucks, there's a great built in app for watching NHL highlights (free)!CONS:--Apple has not opened up the Apple TV platform for app development, but this is not as important with the AirPlay feature.TIPS AND TRICKS:--With the latest software update (v5.3), there are now many apps on the home screen.  You can clean this up a bit and hide the ones you are not using by going to Settings-->General-->Parental Controls.  Scroll to the bottom, and you can toggle show/hide for each app.--To move apps around on the home screen, hold down the 'select' button and then you will be able to move it to wherever you like.--To go back to the home screen at any time, hold down the 'menu' button for a second or so.--Remote control:  You can pair the Apple TV with a universal remote (go to settings to set this up).  You can also control via the 'Remote' app in Apple's App Store, or even pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard (I have not tried the latter).--The Apple TV drives both the HDMI output and optical audio output at the same time.All in all, if you have an iPad/iPhone, I would say get this and enjoy!If you don't have an iPad/iPhone, it is still one of the best streaming boxes out there -- the Netflix and Hulu interfaces are the best I have seen.",

It got annoying after a while so decided to give the Apple TV a try. First off, Amazon has the best price. Now no need of cords! I can use my MacBook Pro, iPad Air, and iPhone to watch Amazon Instant right from my couch! The Apple TV has worked great for my home. I have Comcast and get about 28mbps down and about 6mbps up. I have noticed that on occasion there will be a slight video stutter (never sound though). But nothing major or unbearable. Actually, I noticed my Apple TV software was 6.0 and I had to upgrade it. Now I don't notice a video stutter/lag at all. But I have heard that many people have had problems with this so beware...Other than that it has worked great. If you are thinking about getting an Apple TV, I recommend looking into upgrading your internet speeds if you aren't in the 20mbps range. And maybe to save cost/cancel out cost, look into getting rid of your cable and get AmazonPrime and get their AmazonInstant Videos.",

No, it's not your cheapest option, and yes I'd love for them to update the software (perhaps to match with iOS 7), it's really the best option for someone who uses Apple products. The quality is fantastic, it has all the streaming channels you'd want (those that it might not have, you can easily connect from your phone), and it seamlessly integrates with all of my other iDevices (iMac, Airport, iPhone, iPad).There are a couple of things that bother me, but nothing that makes me not want to use it. For example, the YouTube App is kind of frustrating in the Apple TV, but I find it's just as easy to search on my iPhone YouTube App, then just send it to my TV. Similarly, there is no Amazon Instant App, but I do the same: find it on my iPhone and send it to the TV. And yes, I am ready for them to upgrade the software/interface. It's been a while.As for things I LOVE: It's great for parties, in that I can put my iPad out and open, for anyone to access Spotify and have it streaming through my TV and speakers. Before the Apple TV, I would have had to let people use my computer, which is less appealing. Also, if I've got a group of people over and we are sharing YouTube videos, it's easy for the next person to queue up their video and send it to the TV when it's their turn.All in all, it works like it's supposed to, the hallmark of all Apple products, and the Apple TV is no different.",

For Christmas, I was thinking about getting one of those for my sister, but decided to give Apple TV a shot since she is pretty invested in the Apple ecosystem.The design and build of the Apple TV is great. Though it's not something you'll be handling much, it is very solidly built and looks great as a little set top box.Setup was simple, the little remote is also solid and well built and the system is responsive. Got it connected to WiFi and started showing my sister how to use it. The app selection is smaller than Roku, but I figured that could be made up for with AirPlay.AirPlay worked just like I imagined it would. Easy. I love features that don't take much training since it makes showing family members what to do very simple.Overall I am happy that I chose this for my sister. I still think that other devices may be more versatile for people who do not purchase media through iTunes, but there are many people that do just that; for them, I think this is the device to go with.I docked a star only for the app selection compared to other competitors.",

From those three, I have to say that now that the Roku supports youtube, I think it is probably the best value for this cost.So what is good about it:1) The quality of streaming is probably the best of the three2) Airplay when it works is great for showing pictures, playing music and viewing content of your other apple devices.3) Ethernet and optical connections are very important for stream high quality to make best use of HD TVs",

You can also send content to the Apple TV from iDevices, such as an iPhone or iPad.  This is neat because you can display recorded videos on your TV.I'm going to probably end up putting one of these on each TV in my house other than the main TV where my Windows Media Center resides.I am waiting for the ability to stream live TV from my windows media center pc, but that will come later once a certain group of developers release the tool that enables you to install such a feature.For now I'm happy streaming recorded TV and movies to the Apple TVs.

I have not yet tried to replace my cable TV with this, as so many are now doing, but it looks as though it won't be too hard to figure out. In the meantime, watching You Tube on the 50&#34; screen is a much more satisfying experience than watching it on my laptop, and iTunes movies are a breeze to pull up. I think I will eventually use this in place of my cable. I look forward to denying my local cable company the pleasure of cashing my monthly check.",

The Apple TV has Netflix and Hulu Plus on it which is what my family uses 99% of the time. Roku has more channels, but I rarely watched them. I do like having Spotify on the Roku, but with AirPlay I can easily run Spotify on my iPad and mirror it to my TV/sound system. I think this device is excellent for what it does. My only complaint with the Roku was that it was flaky and I had to reset it frequently. Whether that was the device itself or the software running the channel I don't know. Hopefully it's better with the newer Roku devices. I will still use my Roku on another TV. I also have most of my media in iTunes. If you have a Mac and/or several iOS devices then an Apple TV is worth consideration over Roku. I couldn't be happier with it. My kids enjoy AirPlay because one can play on the iPad while the others watch it on the TV. That solved the problem with my oldest son getting irritated by his younger brothers crowding around him to watch him play on the iPad.In summary, I think both Apple TV and Roku are capable devices. Having other Apple devices in the home was the deciding factor in purchasing an Apple TV for my family. If you don't have other Apple devices then Roku is likely a better choice.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this apple tv awhile back and I was planning to take it back but the 15 days return policy passed. So I got stuck with it. The good things are that it streams really well and is pretty simple to use. The bad side is that it has way to little of choices for streaming compared to Roku. No appstore, no adding stations, way too controled and limited. The airplay seemed like a good idea but in reality Ive got other things to do with my computer besides streaming movies. My kids like to watch programs from some other sites that apple tv does not support. I like to use my computer for other things. I thought airplay mirroring would be really great but it is not very smooth many times. There are so many glitches while air playing through my macbook. Sound problems and video quality have been issues.I cant really recommend apple tv right now. Apple offers limited channels its super limited. Roku offers i believe around 750 channels.  When you turn on your apple tv youll see movies, tv shows, music, dedicated to guess who, yep Apple to buy or rent movies or tv shows of which you can find many on netflix or Hulu with your membership. The hulu plus on the apple tv does not give you all the content you get on your computer. I don't know why, thats even more limited. Amazon prime is not supported along with others. I wish I would have thought sooner. I suggest going with Roku or another streamer at least until apple gets a better selection. Apple makes great products but this particular one is lacking pretty big in available content and as I said earlier the mirroring features with airplay have not worked very well. Consider very well before you invest in apple tv.",

I like it too, but I have issues with it.There's only a couple of things I don't like about this, causing it to get a 3-star rating instead of 5 stars.For one thing, it has an app for Netflix and Hulu, but it has no app for Amazon's Instant Video. Granted, you can stream Amazon content from an iPhone, but it's annoying to have to do that. If my wife didn't automatically assume everything by Apple is the best, I'd have just bought a Roku device because that'll also play Amazon video.The other complaint is the tiny remote. I'm sure Apple-lovers are all swooning over how sleek and stylish it looks, but the remote is just entirely too tiny for my tastes. It gets lost every other day, because it's just so tiny. It's about as thick as a graham cracker, and it's very short and narrow. So it's always being buried and hidden under clutter, or it's always falling into cracks in the couches/recliners. I know it's unheard of for people to ask for bigger electronic devices, but it would actually be appreciated to have a conventionally-sized remote that won't get lost all the time. Frankly, having a bigger remote would allow for programmable shortcut buttons or a small qwerty keyboard which would make the Apple TV even easier to use.",

It also will give you info on theater locations and show times which is nice.  As far as connecting it to your tv it's no problem.  Just plug the HDMI cable in to your tv port plus the power cable into an outlet and that's it.  You do have to also connect to your wifi network which shouldn't be a problem.

My logic was that there were some channels that had apps for watching video for which there was no channel on Roku and either didn't use or limited their Hulu selections.  First, let me say trying to use Airplay from an iPad for this purpose was pointless.  The Apple TV was plugged directly into my AC router which also happened to be in the same room as our main TV.  With no other network traffic, the picture was terrible and it stuttered, stopped, and restarted for no reason.  So, I wrote off Airplay.Still, I paid for it so I was hoping I can still use it on a different TV rather than buying another Roku.  To put it bluntly, the channel selection is pathetic for a device that costs the same as a Roku.  Not only is there no Amazon Prime, there are not just a lot of other channels either.  I've given up on cable/dish, so having as many channels as possible without having to hookup my laptop to the TV is essential.  Here the Apple TV falls very, very short.The user interface is nice and smooth and I actually prefer it slightly over Roku.  The lack of channels is just too big of a drawback for me to overcome.  So, if you can't decide between Apple TV or the latest Roku offering, I would suggest the Roku.",

The rest of the streaming devices I have are all 780p, so streaming Neflix at 1080p and projecting it on to a wall makes it look like you almost blu-ray quality.  I  also 'airplay' music from my PC where I have 100s of songs stored to this device and then to my Pioneer receiver.Now the complaints...con #1: In terms of content, it is rather limited. I have an account with Amazon Prime and would love to watch the free streaming movies available online, but unfortunately it is something I cannot do with ATV3.con #2:  I have on the unit is that it's remote is flimsy and Apple really needs to review the design of it. Quite often, in a dark room, it is hard to locate the buttons on the Popsicle stick like remote. I wish the buttons were not so sensitive or the remote had some low led light although I agree this would consume battery life out.con #3: This is a common complaint, apple needs to figure out the keyboard.  Searching for a movie using the ATV3 can be quite frustrating at times using the onscreen keyboard. I have a 10 year old no name digital recorder and it has the same keyboard, so it is not something i was expecting from one of world's leader in innovation.",

You can stream things from the cloud, so you don't even have to download it anywhere.I wish it did Amazon videos, but it doesn't.I also wish that it would play video from my uPnP NAS.  But it doesn't.  Even though it's an itunes server - but only for music.It does have a bunch of apps that I don't really care about - NHL, ESPN, lots of sports things that I'm not interested in.  And it has Watch ABC and HBO Go and some of the streaming broadcast / cable apps that you can use if you have cable (which I don't).  It has PBS, which is cool, you don't need a cable account for that.And it has Netflix.  But so does my TV.  And DVD player.  And Tivo.  But unlike those other devices, it recognizes Netflix's new(ish) profile feature, where for streaming purposes, an account can set up multiple profiles to make queues easier to manage - I have have shows I watch when I go to the gym in one profile, my kids shows in another, my husband's movies in another, and my movies in another.  All separate queues.  This is the only device I have (of many) that recognizes that feature.  All the rest of them just ignore the other profiles as if they don't exist.My only gripes are the amazon thing, my home network media thing, and that while watching content, there doesn't seem to be a way to get an on screen display to show you how much time you have left without pausing it and restarting it.  Maybe there is a way to do that, but I haven't been able to find it.  That and my general lack of understanding on why apple doesn't recognize a difference between &#34;pause&#34; and &#34;stop&#34;.  But that's a different conversation.",

    "reviewText": "I cannot say enough good things about this unit. I purchased form Target for $99 plus tax. I cut the cable cord some years ago. I was between purchasing a Royku and this Apple TV. I wrote this review because some of the reviewers stated that smart tv owners would not want this. As a smart and basic HDTV owner, I disagree. Also, I cannot speak to the movie sources, etc. because that is not my interest. What I like most is the Airplay feature on the ATV. I have access to content I want on my iPad via the Internet. Being able to Airplay, and not just mirror is worth the purchase. I have used a a digital media adapter on the ipad before but there is no comparison in resolution or presentation for the adapter vs ATV and the adapter will cost about a third of the price for the ATV and still not airplay. So if you are thinking of going the adapter route - probably not. Some complained about the remote. I rather like the little remote, and like that it has some flex in it. I can see that it might get lost in sofa cushions, etc. but I am pleased with it. The ATV was extremely easy to set up. Another point I should make is that I installed mine on a secondary older HDTV that must be about 8 years old or more. As it relates to the discussion of older TVs, this works perfectly. It is an LG and has one HDMI port - ahead of its time when I purchased it. I was concerned about mounting the ATV on the wall mounted tv. I discovered that the ATV does not have to be visible for the remote to sensor to it, so I was able to hide the ATV in the tv casing. So if you want to watch movies, etc. there are apps for that. I like that there is free international news and other free apps. But I mainly use use Airplay to play iPad content - plenty video podcasts - such as time shifted cable news, and other feature programs, as well as free tv internet/cable/tv channels. Of course, photos, notes, and anything else can be air played as well. It did take a while to learn how to move from one tv input to the other without loosing tv functionality- but that is not a problem now. If you are not apple invested, and if you are mainly interested in movies- you may want to also look at a Royku, but this was a best solution for my purposes. And that should probably be the deciding factor, - what do you need a set to do for you that you cannot already do? Hope this helps and was not too rambling.And about You Tube, just Airplay it.",

    "reviewText": "If you are committed to the Apple ecosystem, the Apple TV (latest version) is a must have.  It allows you to stream all of your content from your main computer iTunes account to your TV in a superlative manner.  Additionally, you can stream purchased content directly from the iTunes store -- if you have purchased the content from Apple, you can stream it if you have a sufficiently fast internet service.  The newest software version of this device also allows you to access certain other content providers including Netflix.  Unfortunately but not surprisingly, this device does not allow you to access your Amazon Video-on-Demand account, which is truly a shame.  Nonetheless, this device does a lot and does it extremely well.I have been using Apple TVs since the second version, and it has come a long way.  This latest version unfortunately does away with the on-board hard-disk, which allowed one to place content directly on the Apple TV.  This was helpful for use in boats or RVs, where you might not have WiFi, internet, or the ability to stream from an iTunes computer.  On the other hand, the setup and use of this device is almost completely intuitive, and there is essentially no real setup procedure to speak of.  The device goes into sleep mode after being idle for a time, but simply click the remote and it immediately wakes up.  This works perfectly and effectively, and cures the grip that everyone had with the earlier Apple TVs, which was that they always ran warm, causing users to question the service life of the component.Overall, this is an elegantly engineered and well thought-out accessory that is a pleasure to use.  If iTunes is the major source of your content, this device is nearly perfect.  If not, you can still stream Netflix and certain other content providers, but it is somewhat limited in this regards.

We had no idea what we stumbled upon. We canceled our cable and get all our shows on huluplus or netflix and anything we download on itunes plays beautifully on apple tv or we can take it to go on the iphone or ipad. If you're an apple nerd like me then you'll love apple TV. All your itunes playlists, movies, tv shows, etc play on here!You can also access youtube videos among other stuff like the Wall Street Journal channel and sports junk (that I obviously don't care about).Pros:Works right out of the box.Constant updates making it better and better!Can play anything you've purchased on itunes and can buy new movies, music, tv shows instantly.Beautiful picture on our large HDTV.Netflix! Need I say more?Huluplus! Again, need I say more?You can download the \"remote\" app on your iphone or ipad and use it instead of the apple TV remote from another room or even another location (at work).Cons:The remote is lovely and super thin which equals to it being lost 75% of the time in our house. This isn't really an issue with the remote app on all our other devices, mostly just annoying b/c I'm sure I wouldn't like the remote if it were larger. So not a true con.Wish there was pandora but I'm sure apple will never go for that.Would love more \"apps\" and offerings but I'm sure they're coming!",

You can still watch the shows you like via Netflix, HBO Go, ESPN, etc. but without the commercials & without having to wait until a certain time to watch the show. With the Apple TV, you are in control.I like this better than the Roku because the interface is simple & clean. Also, there is a YouTube app which the Roku doesn't have (major mistake on Roku's part). Lastly, the Apple TV syncs well with the iPhone & mac computers so you can show whatever your phone screen is showing on your TV via Apple TV. This is great if you want to watch a game on The Big Ten Network for example & Apple TV doesn't offer it - you can just put it on your phone or computer & beam it to the TV wirelessly. Pretty solid & I don't consider it very laggy, unless you have a slow internet connection.The YouTube interface leaves much to be desired. You can't read comments, etc. but it's still nice for watching videos. You can also download the Apple remote on your iPhone for free. This turns your phone into a remote & saves you time when typing in the search bar of the Apple TV menus. Would definitely recommend.",

I purchased both for my apartment to have one in the living room and in the bedroom The apple tv is $100 but well worth it, especially if u have apple devices at home such as ipad or iphone. But u dont have to have it to work this.  Apple tv has so many more options then chromcast. If u have a television provider there are disney channel apps, nfl, HBO and more u can use. If u have an ipad or iphone u can turn on air play and use the mirroring option so everything u are doing on your device is on the big screen. Also it come with a remote but u can also download the apple remote app on ur device and control it from there that way u have a keyboard and makes searching for movies alot faster.  Now chromecast is good but only $35 because it doesnt have alot to offer. It doesn't come with a remote so if u dont have a smart phone u cant opperate this device and also only offers netflix and youtube thats it. Easy to set up but nothing fun to play with.",

Some of my songs were added a number of years ago, and Match upgrades these to the highest bitrate automatically, which is another great feature. Anytime I purchase music on iTunes, it automatically shows up on my TV. The same goes for my pictures. I take one, and there it is, instantly, on my big HDTV. I wish Apple would provide me with access to Amazon Prime, but since it's available through the Samsung Smart TV, it's not a big deal, but for convenience sake, it would be nice.

Admittedly, I am one who installs first and reads the instructions later. It is a very easy installation and the quality of the programming such as movies is outstanding. The user interface is easy to navigate and I like the feature where I can see trailers for movies and if I don't have time to watch it now, I just place it in my wish list or queue. They also provide customer and critic's reviews. I am running both Apple TV and Roku 2 XS side by side. I did it because I wanted to see which one was the best overall with the intent to returning one of them. Instead I kept them both. I'll save the Roku evaluation for a little later but they are both very good streaming devices with different user interfaces and slightly different offerings. The quality of streaming HD movies on Apple TV is outstanding. I was pleasantly surprised. There is absolutely no freezing, choppiness (truncation) or any other distractions. I ran out of HDMI ports on the TV (which you must have to ensure the highest picture and sound resolution), so I purchased a HDMI switch to hook both Apple TV and Ruku 2 XS. So depending on which product I use, I just switch back and forth. I would also recommend that you not spend a lot of money on expensive HDMI cables. That is simply a lot of hype. You can buy very good HDMI cables for around $15.00 give or take. Just so you know you must have adequate bandwidth. I run at about 24 Mbps and am using a Linksys Gb router. I feel comfortable saying that you can have half the bandwidth that I have and still have a very satisfying experience.",

My only wish for improvement is for Apple to find a way to offer channel based TV subscriptions, it would be fantastic to put together your own lineup and pay accordingly. It's simply amazing what a small box for less than a hundred bucks can do. I have yet to come across someone who doesn't enjoy using an Apple TV. There's one on every single TV in my household.",

If you are wanting a media system that is reliable, responsive, easy to use and offers solid pack of features the apple TV 3 is the unit to buy.  I have two in my home.  I will give you the pros and an outline of how you have to set up a system with this unit.1. The wireless feature is high quality I have never had an issue with data transfer or streaming video. (my router is in the basement and my apple tvs are upstairs)2. The family share feature allows you to access all your music, photo's and video files on your home network.3. The screensaver options are extensive and easy to personalize. I have 300 photos that cascade across the screen with music playing from my library. Great feature for parties.4. The slideshow feature has a large selection of shows that all play music , play in fixed order or shuffle and are great for parties also.5. The video and photo libraries work the same as the itunes music library so cover art and genres are easy to set-up. (FYI  the video and photos are run through the itunes program)Out line system configuration:If you are wanting all your videos in a network storage system and your DVDs in a box this is the best way to do it from what I have expereinced.You will need all of the items below:1. Dual band Wireless router with 802.11 N speed equiped with video streaming  ( I use a  Belkin N750 Dual Band Wireless N Gigabyte Router2. Network storage device  (media server, DNLP, NOS  I use a WD MY Book Live  6TB)3.  Dedicated work station  ( I use an old window xp tower this computer will sit in the corner and run 24/7  mine is in the basement)4. Apple TV 35. iTunes installed on the workstationThe set up is easy, just follow the instructions for the network storage the My Book Live is super simple.  Install the itunes on the workstation (basic computer for nontechies) connect the workstation to the router and load your media on the storage system then copy links to itunes (drag and drop to itunes).  Install apple TV 3 on tv and follow on screen set up. Activate home sharing on itunes and apple TV now you have access to all your personal media.  (side note: if you don't know how to copy your DVDs to your network you will need ripping software.  Their are several free programs on the net I recommend a software package called DVDFAB it cost $200 for the suite but, is the best I have used no more legal notices, movie previews and can convert standard dvd  and bluerays to appleTv langauage (Mpeg4)",

Compared to the Netflix app on AppleTV iTunes movie streaming dominates. Compared to a Playstation 3 interface the AppleTV dominates. Samsung Smart TV lags terribly in the interface. Netflix app on AppleTV takes forever to buffer, stutters, and has limited content. AppleTV movies play within seconds, never stutter, and have all the new releases you'd expect. AppleTV even has content that hasn't hit theaters yet. If you buy an AppleTV it would benefit you to buy into the Apple ecosystem i.e. iTunes Match, Photo Streams, a Mac computer, and even an Apple WiFi Access Point. When you put all those things together everything just works. It may be a little more expensive upfront but it's worth it when it just works. The most I've had to do is reboot the AppleTV or open and close iTunes but after the last couple of software updates everything has been working brilliantly",

The video and sound quality from YouTube streaming on this Apple TV device  is unbelievable and better than what you get from the Hi-Def channels on dish network.  Netflix video/audio streaming quality is excellent.  Now you know why Apple products are priced higher than competitor's and why their stock price is &#62; $550/share.You can also remotely connect your iPad thru Air Play to Apple TV and view your iPad screen/pictures, etc on the TV screen with no loss of sound or picture quality. Way to go Apple.  Steve Jobs was a genius who clearly differentiated Apple products from the rest of the competetion.The smart TV interface for Youtube and other internet browsing is garbage and hard to navigate.The remote is sleek and very user friendly and has a robust builtin WiFi.No cons except a bit expensive but definitely worth the price.  I will recommend this to anyone who wants to watch quality YouTube, Netflix  streaming and iPad mirroring on the TV.",

    "reviewText": "I have to admit I got a Roku some months ago and then got the Apple TV a month ago...not my initial plan to get both, but I'm glad I did. I use both of them and like them equally. I use different apps on each, so I and my housemate can keep our places in different apps. Since I might only watch for 10 minutes at a time, I don&#8217;t want to spend time opening an app and finding my place in a show.I did set up Plex for Roku, but I way prefer streaming from my iPad or iPhone to Apple TV. Its so much easier to search on the iPhone or iPad, for streaming YouTube, movie trailers, music or videos. Also any friend or housemate in the house with an iPhone can stream to the Apple TV. Besides, there is a fun element of seeing your little devise stream to a big TV.I just checked and I could stream a movie from my iPad Amazon Prime app to Apple TV. It DID go full screen just as YouTube videos do. I couldn't tell on resolution. It looked the same to me when I went back to the Amazon app on the Roku and looked at the same movie clip. I can't swear to it though. If you intend to get the Apple TV and stream Amazon Prime, than I would check reviews on resolution or call Apple. I also don't know what would happen with various iPhones. I believe the resolution went up to at least TV resolution on the recent devises. I would say you DO want HD though if you have a big TV. From Amazon's end of things, I believe Amazon streams to the iPad or iPhone in HD. Last I read some months ago Amazon does not stream movies in HD to computers even if you paid for HD. As long as that is the case, in my mind that might knock Apple TV out of the running for streaming Amazon from a mac to Apple TV.The other issue would be bandwidth.  I am told by Apple tech help that when you stream from a computer or devise to your Apple TV, you are using double the bandwidth.  I have fiber to the home so I haven't noticed any slowing down.As for usability of the devises, I enjoy both Apple TV and Roku. They both handle well, and are quick enough, and both are user friendly.With Apple TV just make sure you pair your remote with the Apple TV.  I didn't know that mine wasn't paired, because the remote was working. But some flaky things were happening in one app which I was blaming on the app. When I called into Apple tech support they showed me how to pair the remote to the TV... phew... that fixed my problems.",

I was told about the Apple TV and said to myself \"so it plays iTunes, it's probably a bitch to set up\"  But, I went and put down the $99 for the unit.  After a day of being able to watch movies (with the surround sound pushed through so the entire experience is maintained)  and listen to music on my PC without having to go through all kinds of hassle I went out and got another for the bedroom.  Now I can easily watch or listen to what I want where I want.  The only requirement is that iTunes has to be running on the PC where you want to play content.  The screen can be locked and if you happen to be using the machine while someone is playing a movie or listening to music you don't have to watch or listen to their selections.  Setup is quite simple and access is controlled via and iTunes store account.  Any purchases made through iTunes are available to you on the Apple TV for streaming purposes.  3rd party Apps are VERY limited.  But that said it does a excellent job of what it does, even though it is limited.  There has been an update so that any IOS devices can \"mirror\" what is on their screen onto the apple TV.  Also the latest generation of Mac's can mirror what is shown on their screen onto the apple TV.  So any net movies can now be viewed on the TV.  A good enhancement.  Overall I'm happy with the Apple TV, just wishing it had more 3rd party app support.  Connectivity on the back includes HDMI as well as fibre optic cable for the audio.

The user interface is easy - anyone can use it. Actually my 75+ year old father in law recently got one, and it's a breeze for him to use. Along with the remote control included with it, navigation of menus is really easy and apple-like. There's also an iphone/ipad app that you can use to control the apple TV, helpful if you lose the apple tv remote (the remote is rather small). The remote has 3 buttons - play/pause, menu, and a button for right/left/up/down/select. It's well made.I use it for netflix. We have netflix built into our TVs. But the user interface for netflix on the apple tv is slicker and easier to use than that on our TVs.The Apple TV has limited channels - not like the hundreds of channels offered on the Roku. I've never tried the Roku, but channel selection would be a good selling point for the roku. But the apple TV integrates very nicely with other apple products. You can use the apple TV to use airplay with your iphone, ipad, mac computer, apple airport express base station. You could use it to listen to music coming from one apple TV but piped into a tv hooked up with another apple TV. I use it to wireless transmit streaming movies and TV from my ipad to my screen via the apple tv. The only problem is that when doing this, the screen size doesn't take up the entire size of the screen.",

While I'm a family with three iPhones and two iPads, it's not compelling enough to have just the Apple TV.  Apples holds the reigns too tightly to be the sole device.  They are slow to add channels and functionallity.I also have a Roku and it provides much more functionallity and a lot more channels.  WIth the use of PlayOn software on my PC and the Roku I have all of the TV I want (recorded, not live) along with Netflix and all of the other video services.",

    "reviewText": "I initially purchased the 2nd generation Apple TV and my family used it so much that I bought the 3rd generation for our other TV. Both versions look the same, but the 3rd gen. supports 1080p.We have a Netflix streaming subscription, and use the Apple TV for that, but there are many devices that offer access to Netflix, Hulu, You Tube, etc. so that isn't the reason to buy this, in fact the Roku box offers more in the web-based steaming channel category at the moment. The real reason to buy the Apple TV is the ability to stream media from your ITunes account.I've streamed my media to devices in the past, including an Xbox and a PS3, but this was the easiest by far. This is the only device ive ever had that my wife will actually take the time to use for streaming purposes. she always complained that the other setups i used were too tedious and unintuitive. With the Apple TV, iif you are on a network, and have a PC with iTunes running and Home Sharing enabled, you can access everything you have loaded into iTunes.Then there is airplay, which allows you to actually use your iOS device to communicate with the Apple TV. Anything you have in your iPhone or iPad can quickly and easily be shown on the Apple TV. Streaming music, videos and even viewing apps has never been this easy. The box does a lot more than what I've mentioned, but these are the main features my family uses.",

YouTube plays well as long as you use Safari, but for some reason sound won't play using Chrome browser.The bad - I first tried it while staying at a friend's house, and found the video choppy -- downloaded videos play smooth as silk on the laptop, but suffers from stutter on the TV. I thought it must be their network or something, and went ahead and ordered one for myself. But I have the same problem here at home, and I have a state of the art setup with high speed everything.And the real reason for such a low rating - Apple support has been a mixed bag -- the first woman I spoke with was snarky and rude and suggested I reset everything in my house and I found her completely unhelpful; the next person I spoke with was more helpful, and suggested I download the latest updates, which I did. They may have improved things slightly, but there is still this hesitation that gets in the way of a wonderful experience.  At least he gave me a case number, so I can call back and see if they have more suggestions. But I think this is a bug on their end, and one they should acknowledge.",

I have it hooked up to my home network - wired not wireless -  with a cable modem connection.I've tried to use it for Netflix movies as well as streaming video from other apple computers over the network.As far as Netflix goes, most of the time it works great. However sometimes it just doesn't want to download my netflix movie or it just drops the movie in the middle.Another annoying thing, Apple updates the software and one time when they did it, some of the netflix features were missing, including access to my instant queue.  The next week or so that came back.  I suspect Apple wants you to use it's Itunes store rather than Netflix, so they make it a little inconvenient.I tried to get some movies to stream from my apple desktop machine, but I haven't been able to make that happen either very well. I got it to work once, but haven't gotten it to work again.One interesting feature is being able to show content from an Iphone or an Ipad.  We had several folks at once showing videos one after another one day - that worked great.Customer service: After about six months, the remote control quit working.  This thing is useless without the remote - it's a brick.  You can't turn it on, you can't do anything with it.I had to make an appointment at the Apple store, then wait in line for my appointment, only to find that nobody in the store seemed to know much about Apple TV.  They took the batteries out of the remote on one of their display units, and since the remote seemed to make the lights on the Apple TV blink, they said I needed to buy a new remote battery (they didn't give me one)...  So I took it home, put new battery in the remote and of course it still did nothing.  Back to the Apple store - where after another hour of waiting they finally found a new remote control for me.  It was an excruciating wait for a $99 device to get fixed.  It would have been cheaper just to buy a new one.  It did work fine after the new remote.I hope they get the glitches fixed.

It's unlike every other streaming device, like xBoxes, Ps3's, iPads, iPhones, Smart TV's, BluRay Players, etc. So with this, you don't get some features other devices get since it's not the Netflix/Hulu experience that you get on EVERY OTHER DEVICE.

The &#34;Max&#34; service on Netflix, again, not there.I hope in a near future update they make the 3rd Party apps the way EVERY OTHER device uses it.Besides that huge con, the device is amazing.

Can listen to the tens of thousands of albums I have in itunes, podcasts, watch Netflix, HBO and several others as well as any of the hundreds of movies I have ripped to itunes.  Also can watch TV or movies on PPV but I haven't used so can't comment.  I now only have basic cable instead of all the bundles and save about $75 a month when all said and done.  Really works well!

And the recent update put HBO Go app on it, so now we don't have to use an iPhone or iPad for that either and it also loads very fast.  I love how small it is and the fact that it has a network port in case wifi isn't readily available (such as having to pay for it in a hotel room).  I bring it with me when I travel and hook it up to the hotel TV - great for catching up on my shows or entertaining the kids.

    "reviewText": "I love my AppleTV. It provides an amazing service that makes it much easier to part ways with your monthly cable TV bill. For just under a hundred bucks, you get access to Apple's entire media ecosystem, including the hottest TV shows and movie rentals in HD. You also get access to apps like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to round out your entertainment choices. And since all of this content is on demand, you don't even need a DVR.Setup and operation couldn't be easier. Just enter your Apple ID, your WiFi credentials, and you're good to go. Once you're online, it's easy to find what you're looking for. The menus are easy to navigate, and while typing in search terms with the included remote can be a chore, you can search for content.The two main drawbacks are 1) you won't find a lot of live content on AppleTV and 2) you can't sit back and channel surf (though in some ways, that's arguably a good thing). A simple HD antenna can do the trick for the major networks, but for events like basketball, you might be out of luck. And while you can purchase NBA, MLB, and NHL packages for use with AppleTV, licensing agreements black out a lot of the games you'll want to see anyway.That said, the amount you save by using and AppleTV over your cable TV service can't be overstated. Even if you purchase four or five seasons of your favorite TV shows and rent a couple of movies, depending on what cable TV package you have, you could easily save anywhere from $500-$900 a year. That's a lot of money. And even if you do decide to stick with your cable TV subscription, movie rentals and access to Netflix and Hulu on your TV still make AppleTV a compelling purchase.",

I've had other smart players with the same apps, but the Apple TV works so much smoother and loads faster than Roku or my smart Blu-Ray, which is great! I'm also really glad I can stream all the movies and tv shows that I've bought in the past, that I don't keep on my hard drive, which saves a lot of precious space on my laptop (which I almost never use for watching TV). Most of all, the definition of the streaming quality is very good. I have it hooked into my bedroom TV right now, which is old so I can't say it's super HD yet, I still need to put it to the 1080p test...but I'm confident that it'll pass. This is a great addition to a high quality Tv's, because the new smart tv's are often a bit slow, and can't connect to other devices the way Apple Tv can. All in all, it makes life a bit easier and my TV watching experience a bit better!CON: The remote is pretty small and sleek, but I often find myself needing to type something in, and it's a total b**ch! I downloaded the remote app to type stuff in, but I don't really like it, sometimes my phone is unreachable! Mostly, I'm usually too lazy to find my phone and open the app. You can connect a bluetooth keyboard, but  I don't want a whole keyboard to sit around, I just wish they had a small remote with a qwerty keyboard on the back to make things easier.",

I was a little hesitant due to issues you sometimes see on your computer with delays, I am happily surprised. This works great, I have only had minimal delays on streaming to load up the show, but after it is going I have had no issues to this point. If this works this well over the next year I think I will look into cutting the cord on cable and test the waters streaming all my shows. The issues I see are: not a ton of options at this point with apple TV, but I just ordered a ROKU that seems to have a ton of watching options so I dropped my star rating to a 4 due to no availability to expand my viewing options on this unit.",

But guess what? The internet shuts down for all the PCs, including the one I have iTunes on. And it's not easy to get it going again. After Googling it, it appears that a lot of other people have the same problem. It has something to do with my router which is a Linksys WRT54G and the IP address. You know what, it should be plug-n-play and it isn't in my case, and I'm not an Apple geek who prefers to spend his life trying to fix what shouldn't need fixing. I suspect if you have a Mac or iPad you won't have this problem, but if you have what I have, you probably will be unhappy. On the plus side, playing your iTunes content through the system or ordering content through Netflix, etc., is very cool. It is the future so I'll keep it and wait until I have a day to fix what shouldn't have to be fixed.UPDATE: Aug 2013. I moved and now have a new comcast router/modem combo and the \"shuts down the Internet problem is gone. After many month I really like the Apple TV, especially the iTunes music capability and YouTube. It is well worth the money when hooked up to your TV and stereo.

If it wasn't for that I probably wouldn't have bought it and instead used a traditional computer with HDMI output for itunes/netflix/amazon.Pros:  Cheap (I paid $80), box itself is small and light, love the look and feel of the remote.  The first standard remote that I don't want to instantly find a way to replace.  Can get to my itunes library on the TV (which I COULD do with a traditional PC but not with chromecast).  Love the way that it turns on and off on its own.  Clean look that even the technologically impaired can navigate.Cons:  More expensive than a Chromecast.  No native amazon app (need to airplay from another device to use amazon prime instant video).Additional Con:  This one is the fault of the American people NOT the fault of Apple or Amazon.  My streaming ability was immediately degraded by my internet provider the second the supreme court overturned the FCC regulation preventing violations of network neutrality.  This product is less useful now than it was in the past because the American people don't care enough about not getting bent over by Comcast/AT&T; etc to elect representatives that will pass laws requiring network neutrality protections.",

I love my AppleTVs.  One in the living room and one in my bedroom.  You can &#34;mirror&#34; your Apple's Mac to ALL your connected AppelTVs, so if you're running a movie for a bunch of friends through your mac (like I have a few times) you can have some of them in the living room and some of them in the bedroom watching the same thing.Enough about my life... the product itself is very intuitive to use, the interface is simple and sleek, and allows for iCloud information to be passed to your ATV (bought music on iTunes but don't have iMatch? No problem. All your music that you bought through iTunes now shows up on your ATV and you can play your music to your hearts content). Bought a movie or TV show from iTunes? It plays it via streaming.  They used to only stream rented movies, but NOW you can play any movies or tv shows that you've fully purchased via iTunes.What it DOESN'T do is allow you to play any iTunes extras (the added features that some iTunes movies comes with).  You'll need to run them through your Mac and send the &#34;broadcast&#34; over to your AppleTV.I also love the fact that it pairs up nicely with my Logitech Harmony remote. As simple as the included remote for ATV is, I like everything to be controlled through ONE remote... ONE remote to rule them all... and Apple TV plays nicely in that respect.Why ATV vs. Roku? Quite simply.... simplicity.  My roommate has my old Roku box.  And what I didn't like about it is that there were a plethora of &#34;channels&#34; to choose from, however, most of them had the same content that I could find on the Apple TV box and those apps (Netflix movies and shows, HuluPlus movies and shows, rental items from iTunes, sports apps, etc). You have to wade through all their &#34;channels&#34; to see what they were about and how useful they are to you. I found a majority of the channels NOT useful to me... even less useful when I found out that you had to pay a subscription services for a majority of those channels. And so this is why my roommate ended up with my Roku box.  He don't care. He's happy to have something for free.",

    "reviewText": "In all fairness, it's only been maybe 1/2 hour. But everything I've tried so far has been seamless. I haven't tried Netflix or other apps, but i have two other devices that can stream Netflix (TV and Blu-ray), so I'm not worried about that if it doesn't work well. Of course it would be nice if it streamed Amazon, but my two other aforementioned devices do that, too, so this was not a dealbreaker. One hint though, if you have a Mac, the remote will try to operate your computer, too. That was annoying until I figured out how to turn it off (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Advanced > click Disable remote control infrared receiver). I don't use a remote with a Mac, but I can imagine that if you do, it may annoy you to have to turn this off completely rather than pairing with a specific remote. There may be a workaround for this, not sure.One thing I really like is that I have two options, I can access what's on my computer or iCloud directly from AppleTV (and use the apps), or I can mirror my computer if I want to stream something that's not an AppleTV app, such as Spotify, through AirPlay (this works with Amazon video, too, but you may need to turn off the AppleTV screensaver), though that does require a few extra steps. I originally bought a Roku 3 but found its lack of flexibility annoying and ended up selling it after one week on eBay (besides that, the Netflix interface on Roku was awful compared with my Panasonic Blu-ray). The AppleTV is about 95% what I was looking for. Now, if someone could just replace my Hopper, receiver and Blu-ray with something this petite! BTW,  I have a MacBook Pro running Mavericks. I don't know if AirPlay works with a PC.And P.S., if anyone is wondering why you might want to send something like Spotify to your TV, my TV audio plays through my stereo system, not through the TV speakers. I used to have to plug my computer (or iPod or iPhone) into the stereo receiver through a &lt;gasp> cable.",

    "reviewText": "I own a lot of Apple products and like being in the Apple ecosystem (itunes, iTunes Match, iBooks and so on).  I think the Apple TV is a near perfect streamer but I'm giving it 4 stars for only one reason: I cannot play music from it and to an airport express at the same time.  More on this later...-Why I got this?I wanted the Apple TV to be able to play music, and watch TV shows (i'm a cord cutter so I pay for a show or two here and there).  I also have speakers in multiple rooms in the house and wanted the ability to play music to multiple rooms simultaneously.  I had two airport expresses prior to the Apple TV.-How does it work?The user interface is smooth, well-implemented and works well.  Beyond iTunes, you also have access to Netflix, HBOGo, PBS, YouTube and a myriad of other services.  It's also nice to be able to show videos and photos shot on my iPhone on the AppleTV.  The Netflix app is one of the best I've seen.The Apple TV can also work with a bluetooth keyboard making it easy to search for content on Netflix, YouTube etc.It would be nice to be able to plug-in an external drive to play content, but Apple does not allow you to do so.  That's ok though as most people don't spend a ton of time ripping their CDs and DVDs anymore.  If you do have a large music collection and want access to it, just get iTunes match for $25/yr.  You'll have all your music up in the cloud and will have access to it on all your devices.  It would be to be nice to be able to store music on a connected external drive as I have kids and one of their hobbies is dragging DVDs on the floor to create deep grooves.  It would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker.-Areas of Improvement1) It would be nice if the next episode will be automatically queued up when watching netflix.  The family got a bit spoiled with this feature on our Sony Blu Ray player.  Again, not a deal breaker2) While the Apple TV has airplay, you can only use the AppleTV to play audio to one output at a time.  This is maddening.  I have to have a computer open with iTunes running to play music to two rooms in the house.  This is one area where I find the apple tv lacking.  It wants to be my media hub and I want it to be, but my computer still needs to be in the mix for me to use it as such.  While this also is not a deal breaker, it is a problem I hope Apple will remedy.-The Bottom Line:The Apple TV is a great streaming device.  It's everything you expect from an Apple product: It's elegant, reliable and easy to use.  It has some areas of improvement, but none of them are deal breakers.",

I'm very impressed with the user interface, and like the fact that it handles my Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriptions  as well as a variety of other networks and specialty programming providers. It's a shame that Amazon isn't represented, but, I suppose they are too much the competitors to allow such an arrangement. Likewise, with the up-and-coming Google TV. Fortunately, I have a Samsung intelligent television that works with some of these competing services.  I didn't want another box out in front of my television, so I bought an inexpensive hanger which mounts the very small and light Apple TV unit from one of the upper vent slots on my TV. The Apple remote is more than capable of handling this arrangement. I've also come to use the Apple remote app on my iPad, but as software goes I think it is as much a public beta as a real product.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased my Apple TV from Apple.  They didn't have a link for reviews so here I am. I specifically bought Apple TV as I read it can stream from iOS devices.  Ok, just what I wanted.  My 3 year old streaming DVD player has a limited Amazon menu.  No wishlist.  Small con but all my purchased vids are from Amazon.  My ipad retains Amazon wishlist entries. When I want to view one of my Prime vids on my HDTV, I have to note the movie title, then use search to find and select that movie on my DVD player's interface.So, after plugging in my brand new Apple TV squarish hockey puck, registering all the passwords for my wireless network WEP, Apple and Netflix accounts, I noticed Amazon was absent from the channel lineup.  Great access to iTunes purchased or rentals vids but the competition was not there.  No surprise I guess.So, on to Amazon vids.  Vids playing in other apps will only display vids through Apple TV if it's Airplay compatible.  Wish I knew that before sending $100 to Apple.  Vids playing on my ipad in Amazon's video app can send audio to the TV but not video.  However, vids in the Apple \"Videos\" app will play through Apple TV.  After all, \"Videos\" is an Apple app. I did notice Apple TV Netflix interface is several times faster than my older DVD streaming player interface.  The remote is what I would expect from Apple, simple and elegant.  30mm wide, 120mm long and 5mm thick tapering down to 2mm at the edges from a single piece of aluminum.  Uses a 2032 button battery. Slender but kinda easy to lose in sofa cushions.I looked into Roku but one reviewer found out that to activate his Roku account, a credit card was mandatory, just in case he made a purchase in the future.  Uh oh.  Another opportunity for a hacked commercial database to spread stolen credit card info, so I will live with Apple TV and continue checking my ipad for my Amazon wishlist movies to search for them in my DVD player Amazon interface.  Such is life, until I buy a newer streaming DVD player.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased the 3rd Generation Apple TV at Best Buy as a means to Airplay music around the apartment with my home stereo. I also wanted to use it for services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon to replace my Playstation 3 for media (I had every intention to sell my Playstation). I'm glad the eBay sale fell through because my intention of using Apple TV as my primary media device fell short.Problems:1. The Apple TV insists I rent HD movies, purchase HD TV shows because that's what I indicated during the setup. The problem with this is that I don't *always* want to watch something in HD. I don't *always* feel like paying the extra $1. Big budget films, season finales are where I splurge for the HD quality stuff. The lack of easy toggling between HD and SD without having to trudge through the settings or purchasing the SD version from iTunes on Mac/iPad first is a real pain and not convenient compared to Sony's Playstation Store which allows options.2. Where is Amazon? Amazon cuts deals with Sony, TV makers, Roku and other devices but can't manage their way into the Apple TV? I don't care who's fault it is, Amazon Prime Instant Video needs to be part of the Apple TV ecosystem. I already pay for prime and don't want to spend money for Netflix which would be completely redundant just so I could watch older seasons of TV. You can work your way around this using airplay mirroring on a Mac, but not an iPad which will block the image with airplay.3. Where is the media server capabilities? Sony has Playstation Media Server, which will push out content from your PC to the Playstation in HD without an issue. Apple TV will remedy this by Airplay Mirroring but it's completely picky about the formats. MKV is a no go, you'll have to spend a few minutes converting the file to an MP4 using MP4Tools (shareware program, works fine) for stuff to function. When it finally airplay mirrors to the apple TV i'll occasionally see stutters in the stream, though it's tolerable.4. Where is the ambition / extensibility? Where is the application store, the iOS game store? There is potential here for Apple TV to be the next big ecosystem for Apple. Like the iPad they could have opened it up for Apple TV specific apps to be built by developers to push their videos and content. But instead they've taken away the jailbreak method, and have very slowly opened up services over time. Apple TV right now just feels like a little box to bide the time while they work on the real successor to their TV ambitions.-----Those are all criticisms, but I'm not fully down on the little box. It's definitely attractively designed. The processor chip inside the Apple TV is smooth and opens services quickly compared to the aging Playstation 3. The interfaces for Hulu, Netflix and the iTunes services are attractively designed and easy to use. The Airplay functionality is mostly very impressive and music sounds great with the fiber optic sound output to the speaker system. The video might be struggling with the wireless N technology, but when things are at their best, the HD Airplay from the Mac looks great. It's pretty inexpensive and that's something you don't hear a lot about an Apple product. Roku is cheaper with more services, but iPhone, iPad or Mac owners should find serious value in Apple TV with Airplay and ecosystem benefits.-----I can't recommend an Apple TV to the non-Apple crowd. There are much better media options. As a streamer, Roku has more services and a cheaper price. For a premium experience the Playstation 3 has a nice Blu-Ray player, Amazon Prime Streaming, Netflix, Vudu, Media Server and video games which really makes it the most well rounded machine for every day use.Where the Apple TV becomes a worthwhile purchase is when you've attached yourself to the iTunes ecosystem for TV/Movies or you want a nice way to mirror videos/pictures/movies from your Mac/iOS devices. There's nothing quite as rad as watching a video game trailer on your iPhone and hitting the Apple TV icon to immediately see it in HD on your TV with your sound system. It's just too bad Apple never went for a home run with this little box.",

I won't watch Hulu, because you get less for the version you pay for than the free one, plus all the same commercials over and over drive me up the wall.  So, basically it's a Netflix box with a little bit of AirPlay or Air Parrot.  I rarely use this because I am too lazy to start it on my computer and move to the living room.  It's easier to watch Amazon Prime on my computer or my iPad.  I don't watch baseball (gasp!), NBA, or NHL, so those are worthless to me.  Also the just added ESPN and HBO are also totally worthless, as I have DirecTV.  What's with that?  So, I am being generous with the 3 stars only because for what it does for me, it does well.  I only wish Apple would quit treating ATV like a hobby and get serious about offering content.  There are reports of a deal with Time-Warner coming, but once again, worthless to me as I can't get TW. Apple, talk to DirecTV!! Please!!Bottom line, if all you are going to do is Netflix and AirPlay on your home network, it does this VERY WELL!

Thus far I've enjoyed it and it has a pretty easy to use interface and seems to be compatible with most of the apps that I use on a regular basis. That being said, if Roku, DirecTV and HBO all got along, I would probably use my Roku more often than the Apple TV. The one thing that Apple has going for it is that it works with all other Apple produces. Seeing as I don't have many other Apple electronics, the Apple TV is really just a gateway to HBO at the moment.",

It's only been in use for a couple of days, but so far, so good.It was reasonably priced and came in a very little box!  It came with a very small and thin remote, but can also be controlled with your iPad or computer (a windows laptop in my case).

Once your laptop and the AppleTV are on the same network, in typical Apple fashion, everything just \"sees\" each other. After a very easy set-up, it's just one click and your laptop display is mirrored on the television set.Most people purchase Apple TV as part of their entertainment system and it definitely did not disappoint in that area. The Netflix and YouTube apps operate flawlessly. Very clean, sleek design for both. Unfortunately (and the reason I cannot gove it five stars), AppleTV does not include a browser like Safari and there are limited apps available, and no means of downloading others.But, if you have an iPhone, iPod or iPad you can display videos using their browsers onto the television you have AppleTV connected. So, no need to catch up on old Episodes of your favorite show on your tiny laptop screen or hunched over your desktop. Display it onto your television screen through AppleTV. I love this feature because I can watch online foreign news channels without increasing my cable bill.Definitely worth the $100!",

The HD is also quite good for something that is streaming.  The sound is also quite good.  I have the sound set up via optical audio into a surround sound system, and the sound is VERY clear.I use it for purchasing TV from iTunes as well as streaming Netflix.  What is really nice about purchasing TV shows and movies via iTunes, is that it preloads what you are watching as it streams, so if your internet connection slows you're quality stays the same.

Here, basically, are the downsides:- the remote uses IR instead of Bluetooth, so it's not 100% reliable. The Remote app on iOS does a good job, however.- Home Sharing (watching a movie or listening to music from a shared iTunes library elsewhere in the house) is unreliable and slow as heck. It's a really disappointing experience- renting/downloading a movie from the iTunes store can sometimes take 24 hours to download, which is ridiculous, given my internet connection.- Overall it feels slow and unresponsiveSo, it's not perfect, and I can see lots of areas for improvement, but it's a nice product.

Check out this video review. The setup and interface between the Apple TV and my router/modem was simplistic Like most Apple products, the quality of the hardware and the ease of use helped make my choice.The only reason I did not rate the Apple TV 5 stars is that the product is lacking applications. Both the Apple TV and Roku both have Netflix, However, the Apple TV does not have Amazon Prime Video which Roku does. I hope Apple will add this application to their menu in the near future.If you are looking for a streaming video box that is easy to use, quick in its response time, and small in its hardware design, then I would recommend this product.",

But another great feature is the mirror option.  If you have an iPhone, iPad or Apple laptop computer, at the touch of one icon you can stream the content from the device to your Apple TV.  Want to show some pictures to your friends, just press an icon and mirror your phone to your Apple TV and see them on the big screen.There are so many things you can do with your Apple TV, and Apple seem hell bent on adding more and more features.  Just this week they are streaming a concert live from Austin, free for Apple TV owners.  In the fall they get 30 artists to film an exclusive concert, and show these concerts for free.Various TV channels are getting involved too, so you can stream a surprising amount of free content without having to subscribe to a ton of stuff.As with all Apple products, it isn't the cheapest choice, but it is one of the best.",

This is no learning needed for folks using these and so problem solved.b) Natively on Apple TV you can access any content shared from a itunes client on any machine. Again I have a MAcbook that is always on serving the itunes for iphones and ipads sync and so this is not new requirement for me. So works great with it.c) The UI for netflix and youtube are much simpler and refined than other devices including Roku which I tried in another place.One thing to do however is in settings menu for playlists by defualt it would only show music play-lists. With this I felt stumped when none of my video play-lists in itunes was seen forcing me to browse the long list of videos.... But turning this option to show all play lists fixed this and now it works like a charm.If you already have itunes as your work-flow this is a great option. Otherwise options can be there like DLNA players which can connect to your NAS, but UI is not that good and not for non-geeks usually.Why 4 stars.... Some things like Flickr and other options are very rudimentary to useless and slow. I hope there is a fix for flickr since that is one another place I have tons of photos already uplaoded and want to use that.",

Type in your Apple ID password and confirm that you want to setup the TV and BAM! The Apple TV is setup with your wifi password and iTunes account info.Simple as can be!The only thing missing from the Apple TV options (for me) was Amazon (not surprising since they compete) but it's easy enough to run the Amazon Instant Video app on my iPhone and use Airplay to shoot it over to the Apple TV. The recent addition of WatchABC is awesome and now gives me ABC On Demand in our bedroom (we have a bare minimum cable box in there).I would also suggest installing the Apple TV Remote app on your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.",

Radio stations on it are my main priority, most of them sound crystal clear (with the exception of few.)  500 channels of whatever genre I want at my fingertips is just awesome!  Add a slideshow of all of the pictures that I've ever taken with my iOS devices is just so cool.  The remote app for it works perfectly, and the remote that comes with it is one of the few high quality remotes that I've ever seen.  It also has some of the best reception, working about 50 feet away.  1080p looks brilliant!  YouTube very rarely need to buffer.  AirPlay is delayed by a few milliseconds, but you really only notice it when gaming, and I got used to it quickly.  I love being able to push a button on my phone or iPad, and instantly see a mirror of my screen on my TV.  The build quality on this good.  It's plastic, but it still feels pretty dang good for something that'll be out of the way most of the time. (not as good as the 1st generation build quality though). Overall, a very solid addition to your setup, perhaps this will be the one device to bind it all together, as its done for me.  Highly recommended.",

Intermittently, a show will not load, but that it mainly due to my wifi connection cutting out. The box is very small and can be mounted to the back of your TV with hardware that I have seen on Amazon.The cons of this product are few, but may be important to you.1. The remote is TINY! I know that you can download the Remote app on your iPhone and use that, but I like having a separate remote to use since I do not always have my phone by my side while watching TV. This remote can get lost easily if it get left on the couch or on the bed.2. No Amazon Prime Instant Video!3. This may not be true for all, but if I am playing a DVD through my MacBook Pro and mirror it to my Apple TV it is unbearable slow. The video skips or completely stops. I was so excited to use the mirroring feature for this purpose since I  do not have a DVD player attached to my TV with the Apple TV, but I never use the feature because of its poor performance.These cons may not be issues for you, but they can be a bit of a nuisance.

Streaming this content to my TV is very easy with this device. The content is maintained through iTunes and it's a simple matter of turning on Home Sharing on your computer, and signing in on the Apple TV. Obviously a wired connection is preferable but I've found a wireless connection works fairly well also. I've only had a buffering issue a few times but blame that on my old wireless router.The UI is similar to that of an iPhone or iPad; there are multiple apps available for the user to choose from (most of them existing services you need to sign up for) and it's as easy as signing in to use the apps. We use this for Netflix, Hulu, and MLB TV, all of which work great on the device.The device is small (the remote even smaller) so you won't have to take up a lot of valuable space on your entertainment center to enjoy it.

Unfortunately, Apple TV is a HDMI output only device, which sucked cause my TV although full HD is a older model that doesn't have HDMI inputs.  So I really thought I was screwed and wasn't going to be able to use the Apple TV as I really wanted to unless I bought a new TV.  Well that was out of the question so I started looking for HDMI to composite converters and thanks to Amazon again found ViewHD Two Input HDMI to RGB Component YPbPr / VGA 2x1 Switch Converter Support 5.1CH Surround Sound, did take about a hour to get everything right and set up but thankfully it converted the signal from the HDMI on Apple TV to the YPbPr connection.  Setting up aside, the Apple TV is amazing, its basically like getting iTunes to run on the TV screen.  So i'm glad that after all that had happened that I got it, was well worth it.By the way some have been saying that ViewHD Two Input HDMI to RGB Component YPbPr / VGA 2x1 Switch Converter Support 5.1CH Surround Sound doesn't work with Apple TV Gen 3, and it may not depending on your set up but for me it works fine and my TV is a RCA 55' Full HD 120Hz from probably 2004 or 2005 can't totally remember think I bought it Christmas 2004.",

I no longer get ripped off paying $72.00 a  month for lousy cable TV.  Now I watch what I want, when I want, for a $4.00 monthly fee to Netflix.

    "reviewText": "I've had this device for about a month now and thought I'd give some impressions which might aid those considering a purchase.First, on the device itself. It's small in size and works well. I recently cancelled my pay-TV package because it was just too expensive for the amount of time I used it. I had 500 channels and watched about 1 of them. My main viewing interest was in watching NHL hockey games, and I watched nothing else, so why pay for what I wasn't using? NHL games were available through Apple TV for $100 dollars a year&#8212;about what I was paying each month for pay-TV. A good deal. I find that I actually get a better picture through the Apple TV than I got through my pay-TV provider, so I'm satisfied with how the device works.Now, what I'm not so satisfied with. First, in the NHL TV package, the games come on when the games begin and end immediately when the games are over. What's the big deal about that? Well, I like to get at least a little pre-game and post-game coverage. I'm not expecting complete pre- or post-game shows, but at least a little something. I don't need the game to switch off the second the final buzzer sounds. This isn't Apple's fault. I'm sure it's in the NHL TV contract. I won't reduce my rating because of this, but it's something to consider for sports fans because I'm sure it's the same deal with the NBA and MLB packages.There is not enough content available from Apple TV. Looking at the list available through Roku, they seem to offer a lot more, and a greater variety. For instance, I'm a subscriber to Amazon Prime. It's not directly availably through Apple TV. I've read here in reviews that you can view Amazon prime videos through Apple TV by mirroring your iPad, but I haven't been able to make this work. Oddly, I've been able to get the sound, but not the picture. I hear the program, but get a blank screen. Maybe I'm dumb, but Apple prides itself on making easy to use & intuitive devices so dumb guys like me don't have to bat our brains out getting the devices to work. Besides YouTube and the NHL games, there is really nothing available on Apple TV that I want. So I take a star off for that.I'm a long time and loyal Apple user, going back to the days of the Powerbook 160, and I like Apple products, but it's a love-hate relationship. Some things about Apple products bug the hell out of me, and a prime example of this is the Apple TV remote.Apple seems to have a design protocol that states that all their products will have a sleek, minimalistic, zen-like design with no bumps, protruding surfaces, seams, buttons or breaks to distract the eye. They want their products to have a certain &#34;look&#34; or, as they might call it &#34;sensory experience&#34;. This may all look very well in a salesroom display, but we customers have to work and deal with these things, and what looks good doesn't always work good.The new model of the iMac is a perfect example of this. They designed a light, sleek (a real Apple word there) razor thin display unit that almost disappears when you look at it from the side. A wonderful technological accomplishment, but Apple doesn't seem to realize that just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you SHOULD do something. In my work with computers, a DVD-R/optical drive is a necessity. The new iMac, with its sleek chassis, has no room for a DVD-R drive, so if I want to use a DVD-R drive, I have to buy it separately, hook it up to the computer, using up a valuable USB plug, and have it sitting by the computer with cables running all over the desk. Hence we get the sleek, elegant zen design of the iMac with an un-sleek, inelegant dvd-r drive sitting next to it on the desk, with spaghetti like cables running from the drive to the computer. Sort of ruins the sleek, elegant, minimalistic effect, nicht wahr? Dammit, this thing is a DESKTOP computer, not a laptop. It's not something I'm going to carry around in a briefcase. Do I need it to be sleek, razor thin, light, when it's going to be sitting on a desk? The design is eye-catching and you may say, &#34;wow!&#34; the first time you see it. The ten thousand times after that, it's just another thing sitting on the desk. Recently when I needed a new desktop computer and discovered all this, it was the closest I've ever come to switching from Apple. I didn't, but I did go out and buy a used, reconditioned 4 year old iMac, which I'm satisfied with.Sorry for wandering off the subject, but I felt a need for an Apple rant. Back to the Apple TV remote. It's another one of those sleek, almost invisible, disappearing designs Apple so loves. But do the Apple designers ever watch TV? Do they ever use a remote control? Do they realize how easy it is to misplace a remote control? Don't they know the frustration of having a remote slip down in the sofa cushions when the user doesn't know it's slipped? Do these people live in the real world, or in a hermetically sealed container constructed completely of sleek, aluminized, elegant zen surfaces colored only in shades of white, black and gray? The Apple TV remote is ridiculously small, ridiculously thin, and just perfect to get lost with the least bit of inattention. It is a thing designed to win design awards, not to be used. So I reduced the rating another star for this.It's a shame, because the Apple TV device is really a nice item. It works well and, as I said, gives a very good picture. But there is a severe lack of interesting viewing content. If that is improved, I will revise this review and bump it up a star. I don't suspect they will ever change the remote device&#8212;it goes against their senseless design ethic. Since the remote is such an essential part of this device (it's useless without a remote), and the remote is such an annoying (if elegant) design, this thing will never be a five star item for me.",

    "reviewText": "I've owned a roku since they came out several years ago.  I love my roku, that now lives in our bedroom.  We moved to the AppleTV mainly because I wanted to ditch cable and save some money.  Being in an Apple household (2 macs, 2 ipads) it just made sense for us to move to the Apple TV, but the main reason for us was the iTunes integration.  iTunes had everything we wanted to watch, so we knew moving to the AppleTV was going to give us the widest range of options for watching what we wanted.In addition to Netflix, Hulu & iTunes rentals and purchases, you can access anything that's in an iTunes library on your network.  So we've converted all of our DVD's to .mp4's and stored them in iTunes so we can quickly get to the videos we or the kids want to watch.  It's easy enough to operate that my 3 year old can use it, and has parental controls to block access to specific channels that I don't want my daughter getting to (like You tube). I do wish it would allow you to block content by rating, however I've yet to see that on any set top box to date.The one thing that really bothers me on this unit is that backing out of an app is a bit of a pain.... It's essentially hitting the back arrow on your browswer... back for every movie you've viewed till you get back to the home screen.  Not sure how Apple missed the boat on that, but overall I can live with that.",

I won't get into the details as all the other reviews cover most of the plus points. I'll just offer some lessons from my learning curve.For those with a high-end A/V system and planning on using a Logitech 900 remote, I'll just say this was fairly easy to set up under \"activities\". Tip: you won't find a \"logical\" category for it in the remote set-up guide, so instead look for it under \"computers/Media PC\" and type in Apple TV as the device. I have this little guy tucked away in a closet in the bedroom and controlled by the RF blaster. It's hooked up to my Harmon Kardon A/V system using the optical cable for sound with video through HDMI. Wi-fi is over a newer dual-band Cisco router. No problems at all streaming HD movies at 1080i!One other tip for those planning to stream video through iTunes. When converting/ripping HD movies (720 or 1080) using handbrake or some other program make sure to set your fps rate to 30. Anything less, and you'll get very \"choppy\" almost slow-motion output to the TV. I tested every scenario to try to fix this problem until realizing it was the fps setting! Also keep in mind that ATV does NOT play all types of files and MPEG4 (MP4) is the preferred type. Some formats such as MKV, AVI and others will not load into iTunes and subsequently ATV. You'll need to \"jailbreak\" it to be able to use other formats (Someone please let me know when you figure it out..haha!!).",

I wish it had more channels like the Roku, but Airplay makes up for that for everything I personally watch.  It will be great if and when Apple decides to allow more apps on the ATV.  It has huge potential.  The biggest drawback for me is the lack of support for external storage.  I already have an HTPC setup so it was not difficult to keep iTunes open to watch all of my videos.  But if I could just attach an external HDD with all of my music and videos, that would be ideal.  Roku does this to a limited extent.  There are other devices that allow external storage I know, but they have drawbacks in support and function that just aren't worth it.  So I will stream ITunes for now and wait to see what Apple comes up with next.  I have an Xbox and previously used it for all of my streaming.  So far I am happy with both, but we'll see how they compare over time, especially with Netflix and Hulu Plus apps.",

    "reviewText": "Just when I thought I had a good flat screen, withApple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION] Apple TV, it became a great TV. To start with, music from my computer never sounded so good using Apple TV. I play the music through my old Pioneer sound system (using the AUX input red white and a cable going from the red white out on the TV to the AUX  input on my Pioneer) and it's like I have my own mini theater.There are pod cast programs I can access which makes my TV an educational tool in ways I had never imagined. The real joy is being able to show movies I have created on my iMac and showing pictures of family and friends as a slide show with music added instantly. I use my iPod in ways that give me more for the money than I had ever thought possible. If you are looking for first run movies, you'll find them on Apple TV as well. With the price of movies going up all th time, it's so nice to invite friends over to watch a current movie playing in theaters in the comfort of your own home. You can stop the movie any time and go back to it or go back to a sceen you want to watch again if you like. Rentals are good for 24 hours so you can keep on sharing if you like. HD movies never looked so good. Being able to access Netflex using Apple TV is a real bonus for me as well. I can look at TV series that I may have missed or movies that I have forgotten all about and would like to see again. On Netflex I can find movies for the children in our family so I can let the kids watch what ever they like on a TV in a separate room. This is one of the best purchases I have made. Apple TV comes with WiFi built in so you don't have to buy a USB adaptor for your TV to access WiFi; Apple TV automatically does that using a HDMI cable (not supplied) connected from Apple TV to your TV. If you have wireless access to the internet, all you need is Apple TV and am HDMI cable; it's that easy. I thought it would be compicated; boy was I wrong.",

With apple tv I can stream the CBS app on my iphone and have it play through my TV.  Why do you need this?  Well we dumped our cable and CBS shows are only available online or apps.  This is a super easy way to keep current on all our shows.  You can do this with anything else on your iphone or ipad.  I use the iphone because the stream window is almost full TV size where the ipad is minimized.2.  I was blown away by the HD quality.  It puts roku to shame.  My wife, who can't tell the difference between standard def and HD on  Uverse even noticed the difference between the roku and the apple tv.Why didn't you give this a 5 star rating?  2 reasons:1.  You can't watch your amazon prime, though as I write this I haven't tried mirroring from my phone.  C'mon apple, add the app.2.  You can't add any channels. You get what apple gives you.  This is where Roku shines.  My recommendation get both.",

Small form-factor box and remote, not a lot of buttons to fumble around with. Netflix operation is nearly flawless compared with other media PC options I have used in the past (Windows Media Center, for example).What is missing from this product (and the rest of the Apple iTunes setup) is a server device so I can effectively play my movies that I have in mp4 format using the Apple TV. Currently you have to have another computer running iTunes with Home Sharing enabled to be able to play your movies that are not downloaded from the iTunes store. On top of that, the Home Sharing setup is not the most reliable. I have had to restart iTunes on my computer and restart the Apple TV to get the Home Sharing library to show up on the Apple TV. It just seems to stop working occasionally.Apple, get your act together. Put in some way to stream movies from either a NAS device or a home server to the Apple TV!",

I did my research and decided on the Apple tv.  The setup was very easy, even for someone like me with only a limited technical background.  I used a hard wire connection with cat 6 cables and a HDMI auto switch so I could hook up both the ATV and a blu ray to one one HDMI port on my TV  The increase in speed from turning on the equipment to watching a movie on Netflix was simply unbelievable.  No waiting for 20-30 seconds or more for the blu ray to load.  It was almost instantaneous and the improved navigation was wonderful.  Coupled with the simple design and Apples reputation for quality make me very glad that I chose the Apple tv.  I wanted a system that would last and not give out in a year or two.  The final reason I chose ATV was for its ability to view my pictures off of my other apple products.",

If you are watching Hulu Plus, same thing.  The Roku will at least offer Autoplay in many apps, including Hulu Plus, where you can marathon a series without being interrupted to needing to find the remote after each episode and then click around to get to the next episode.My other gripe is Airplay with a mid-2012 Macbook Pro (upgraded with 16B ram and 512GB SSD) along with 80 MBps (yes, eighty MBps) wired internet.  There is a lag of about 1-2 seconds when you use the Airplay feature to play what you have on the laptop on the TV.  Voices do not line up with the audio, which is very annoying.I just find the AppleTV very limited at best.  Yes, I can watch video from my iPhone 4S, iPad 3, or 2012 MBP on my TV, but that's really about the extent of this device.I own a Roku 2 HD, PS3, Wii and Wii U, iPhone 4S, iPad 3, mid-2012 MBP.  I use the PS3 the most for streaming, followed by the Roku 2 HD.  I lent my AppleTV to a family member, who I think after one or two days gave up on it, and it is siting in their drawer.If Apple opened the AppleTV up to app makers for more streaming video choices, as well as the ability to Autoplay, then I would highly recommend it.  Problem is the are far too few choices for streaming, and there is no autoplay feature.  It's just too limited when you compare this device to competitors.",

Streaming photos and access to your music playlists is great.CONS: The only con so far is the \"random\" photo streaming... the random setting doesn't seem to cycle through the pictures very well.. I will see the same pic out of 300 a couple times just in the first 15 minutes the photo's are streaming.  that being said, not a real good reason to take any marks off the review.With the Apple TV and subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu, We aren't missing cable at all!!",

    "reviewText": "My main reason for purchasing the Apple TV over ROKU, was so I could access my very large iTunes library in the living room. It does this beautifully, but what I didn't expect was superior performance when streaming from Hulu Plus, Netflix and YouTube. There are a lot of the apps that are also resident on my Vizio TV set, but many that are not, and vice versa, so this also added an expansion of my streaming ability. Set up in a few minutes without a hiccup! Note too, that i am using a PC, not a Mac, and I am not particularly Apple-centric, but I find iTunes to be the best app for compiling and centralizing a music and video library. I can also access my library via my Samsung tablet using Samsung Link and have iTunes open for the Apple TV and other Apple devices without any conflict.Now for those considering getting one of these in order to stream from your personal iTunes library, you can do so without any concern.There are some limitations on video format, but if your primary player is iTunes, and the video plays there, it will play via Apple TV.My audio files in iTunes are loaded as uncompressed .wav files as opposed to using one of Apple's codices. I am an audiophile and many of my files, particularly home recordings from LP, are high resolution at 96kHz 24 bit, as well as the typical 44.1kHz 16 bit CD files. Absolutely no lag or bottleneck to the flow. I am currently piping the audio into a stereo system from the TV set's line out jacks, and the quality is nearly as good as playing the files directly from the computer into the main system it is hardwired into.At first I couldn't locate the proper playlist option, and assumed that the playlists weren't working. Turns out it was a simple matter of selecting the sort option to sort by name and then scroll up and BAM!, there it was. I thought at first too, that it wouldn't automatically play the next video in my iTunes playlist, but again, that was my slip, not the unit.It earns a 5 star rating from me, as it is a simple yet elegant solution to accessing my media library remotely. We may have to get a couple more for other rooms in the near future.",

Typical Apple mentality - I didn't take any thought to start streaming music and videos from our other Apple products.  I'd like them to sign on to the Amazon App next so i can stream Prime content.  Also, I wouldn't order movies off of it as they are several dollars more than through Amazon (which we stream through a PS3).  The remote is typical Apple - small, simple, and just works.  I got this before Google ChromeCast came out.  I would say there are regrets, but CC doesn't yet have the Apps, and the AppleTV interface (assuming you have apple products) works seamlessly.",

    "reviewText": "Okay, my initial plan was to save up and just buy a mac mini and hook up an external hard drive to play all my iTunes library, but that's going to take a while, and in the meantime, I had 4TB of iTunes videos (sad, I know) that had no way to get to my TV...so I picked this up. (Thank you, refund fairy!)It was a nice surprise that it didn't make me authorize it, since I've maxed out the number of devices I can authorize, and I didn't know who was going to get cut from the lineup (again, weep for me and my troubles!) and that made life nice.The downside was that the apple remote was operating my laptop and the apple TV at the same time, so while I got it on the network I think I watch/paused about five movies on my computer.I had to turn the home sharing feature off, then on again on my laptop to get the streaming effect going (not airplay, I think my computer is too old for that to work without airparrots assistance, but I hooked this up yesterday so haven't tried too hard yet) and then later when I went to change videos I had to do the same thing. Minor issue for me, but if you're operating a desktop in another room you might be led into temptation to use bad words after that goes on for a while. Also if the computer you're streaming from goes to sleep, that may or may not affect whether the movie continues (I just muted a really long music playlist)So I love this thing, but I also have months of iTunes exclusive video to play with...if you primarily watch other kinds of videos, I don't know that this will bring you nearly the skeeky joy it brought me. Best of luck though!Also I used a mediabridge HDMI 3D quality cable, and the picture is gorgeous, even the SD stuff I tried.",

The Apple TV recognizes this and instructs you to buy the latest iPhoto app at the iTunes store.For $89 and free prime shipping: I would recommend it and I would buy it again because it gives me options away from my basic cable source.Update Dec-30th 2013: I asked my teen daughter which see likes better the Apple TV or ROKU and she said Apple TV because it was much faster than ROKU to access programs.

Have Netflix and Hulu Plus which, mostly, fill in the gaps.  I miss AMC (The Walking Dead) and the Food Network but can live without them.  More channels have been added to Apple TV which has made it that much better.My one frustration is how well it plays (or doesn't play) with our other apple products.  One of the selling points is that you can mirror a show from your laptop, iPad, phone etc and it will be a seamless transition. I've found it to be not as pleasant a viewing experience as more times than not the video is skippy. It is a broadband hog. If someone is online playing video games then the mirroring is worse and it interferes with the gaming experience as well.It would get 5 stars if it played better with the other apple products and if it had amazon on there so we could use Prime to view TV and movies",

Using 3rd Party apps such as AcePlayer or Air Video, you can browse all of your network's shared media and play almost all of it through the Apple TV.While other media streaming devices can also browse and stream your content, this product succeeds because 'it just works' quite well and without a lot of fuss, and also does so with an attractive and easy-to use interface.Works so well in fact that it allowed me to re-purpose a Mac Mini that was being used as a Media Center PC -- now my kids have an extra Mac to work on.Rated 4-stars due to lack of Netflix integration at this time, though many will not find that much of a limitation -- it's only a minor point in my case.",

It provides a very &#34;clean&#34; interface, and it's easy to rip videos (using Handbrake or similar) that will work on your iPhone / iPad which will also work on your AppleTVs.As for the negative aspects of the product, it's similar to any other Apple product.  The biggest disadvantages to the product is a tradeoff for the impressive UI and hardware design--you won't be able to plug in a USB jump drive with an XviD encoded AVI on it and expect it to play.If you use an Apple TV on a home network (or a series of AppleTVs), I'd plan on dedicating a computer to a stable iTunes server that holds your music and movies/TV Shows that you want networked so that you can take full advantage of the convenient interface.",

AirPlay allows for any iOS device running iOS 4 or later to play any video or audio over Wi-Fi. AirPlay mirroring is supported on the iPad 2 and later the iPhone 4S and later, or Mac 2011 and later, which allows for whatever is on your device screen to be mirrored to your HD screen without a VGA cable. This is great for Demos, gaming, and Presentations.Another underrated future, is iTunes Home Sharing, which is supported across every iOS device and Mac computer already. That allows for everything in your iTunes library to be streamed to the TV, including encoded DVDs or Blu-rays. I legally encode the physical media that I own and store it on a hard drive.

Take three, however, brought 1080p, more RAM, a better processor, and a new interface.

As with my iPad, there are many, many functions that exist, but one usually only finds them when a friend points them out.  This appears to apply to the Apple TV.In addition, if I want to stop a video and try to start it up again, I get an error message every time.  It requires me to &#34;try again later,&#34; which may require me to wait a full 24 hours to get back to the video.  I also find the remote to be, as usual, unclear.

I used to own the Roku 2 and it was an inferior product both aesthetically and functionally. The obvious advantage that the Roku had over the Apple TV was the channel selection but that was about it. Setup on both devices is easy.  Plug them in, they find your wireless network and after the password is entered, you're good to go.  You have the option for a wired connection but for some reason the wireless works better on my network.  The GUI on the Apple is smoother and looks better than the one on the Roku.  The Roku is clunky and it takes forever to scroll through the channels, whereas the Apple has the channels on a grid pattern.  Picture quality is also superior on the Apple TV and the wireless streaming has been glitch free.  I had trouble setting up the homesharing but once it was up and running that also has been free of problems.  The only reason I removed a star on the rating was because of the performance of Airplay.  The sound quality is poor and it fluctuates during playback, becoming louder and softer continuously.  This could be a problem with my network but other people have also complained of this.  The bottom line is that this out performs the Roku with the disadvantage of a small channel lineup  which didn't matter to me because the main reason for this was the home sharing and the use of Netflix.",

To resolve the crash you need to connect the apple tv to your computer.  The cable to connect it to the computer, however, is not supplied.  None of the apple cables I have would work.

I primarily use it to watch Netflix or stream videos from my desktop via my IPad to the Apple TV. There are couple of ways I do it. I use Air Video or Air Playit to stream to my IPad, and Airplay to my Apple TV. I have a shared folder on my computer that these streaming apps can connect to. I haven't noticed any lag or delay in playing movies, even large files. MP4 files can play directly from Itunes to the Apple TV. No need for IPad to be in the middle in that scenario. Sometimes I also use Splashtop Remote desktop to connect to my computer and browse on the bigger screen. Splashtop only works with the Mirroring option. For those of you who are new to this, AirPlay and Mirroring are 2 different things and if you do a google search on it, will tell you how to do it.Netflix quality  is much better than what I used to get on my Wii netflix app. I haven't tried to play any games using mirroring, so can't speak to that.So far, I am really happy with my purchase.

However, I already had no less than ten devices (four computers, one tablet, two smart phones, one game console, and two DVD players which worked well with Netflix. I primarily bought this for \"home sharing\" and to see what else it was capable of. Well, it has few other capabilities that are of more than passing curiosities to me, and the home sharing works horribly. I just spent about a half-hour getting the Apple TV to play a movie through home sharing. Five minutes into the movie, it stopped and displayed the message \"To access your iTunes library on Apple TV, turn on Home Sharing in iTunes on your computer.\" Obviously, \"home sharing\" is already turned on. Another ten minutes of tinkering and (hopefully) I'll be able to watch my movie. This problem didn't seem to occur when I first bought the Apple TV two months ago, but it seems to occur every time now. Extremely frustrating. If you want to access a streaming service like Netflix, the best solution is to connect a computer directly to your TV. You should also be able to access multimedia files directly from your home network, without the added hassle of iTunes. The simplest solution fr streaming is a DVD player, which would be far more functional than Apple TV at only two-thirds the price.",

In fact, since getting the Apple TV I haven't even turned on the Wii. The Apple TV is much faster at downloading content for play and rarely pauses during playback. For that alone, I would have given the Apple TV 3 stars. Because there's so much more to love about the Apple TV, I've given it 5 stars.Things I love:1. Airplay Mirroring - if I want people to see something I'm doing on my MacBook, I turn on Airplay Mirroring and just like that, it's on the TV. No more trying to squeeze in to see the MacBook screen or dragging a cable across the room to connect the MacBook to the TV.2. Playing content from a computer - as long as Home Sharing is setup I can pull music and video directly from a computer and play it on my TV. The perfect exercise music is always easily accessible.3. Customizing the Home Screen - with the latest Apple TV update, I can remove the home screen icons that I don't use. With parental controls I was able to remove some of them before, but now I have complete control, minus a few \"required\" icons.4. The Remote App - conducting a search on the Apple TV can be somewhat of a hassle if you are using the Apple Remote that it comes with. Once I started using the Remote App on my iPhone, a keyboard pops up on my phone that I can type the search query in. Down, down, right, right arrow pushing is not required to get to the next letter.5. Size matters - the Apple TV is so small, making it easy to place anywhere. I set it on top of my DVR along with aKinivo 501BN Premium 5 port High speed HDMI switch with IR wireless remote and AC Power adapter - supports 3D, 1080p, which is on aOmniMount Tria 1 B - 1 Shelf Wall Furniture (Black/Dark Glass)mounted behind/above my TV.6. iTunes integration - renting or purchasing new movies/TV shows from iTunes is so fast and easy. If I have subscribed to a TV show, the show automatically downloads to the Apple TV. And I can also choose to download purchases to my MacBook if I want.",

I love the AirPlay from my iPad and my Macbook, but I've yet to find a practical use for it in my house - it has come in handy on the ones we have at our office though.The very stylish but annoyingly tiny remote control is a frequent pain point. The fact that it is so small means it's always under our butt, between the couch cushions or otherwise hiding. I really just wish it had a normal size remote control as we've evolved our livingroom habits to efficiently manage those without losing them or sitting on them (much).Overall I'd say this product is well designed and fun to use but a bit too closed (platform limitations) and lacks a lot of the functionality I've come to expect from apple products.",

It hooks up to the TV via HDMI, and if you can get a mounting kit for it (about 15 bucks here on Amazon) it's not even visible as you can hide it behind the TV and the remote still works.1080p HD makes the image look great, and it hooks up to your wireless device to stream from either your computer or any online streaming service available (I use it primarily for Netflix regarding online streaming).Another use it has is streaming images and videos from your iPhone or iPad. You can set up slide shows using your images, show videos, or listen to audio from it. Everything is wireless- no cables required. You can also stream your Mac to the TV using airplay, also no cables!Even though the control is kind of clunky, it's small and gets the job done. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can also control it using an app on these devices, which is actually extremely useful.I can't recommend this enough. Every house should have one on their main TV!

I got this to supplement my Roku boxes, mainly in order to be able to view content that I purchased from Apple's iTunes and stored in the cloud (which I can't do with a Roku) on Apple's servers.There's a huge improvement in the resolution on the Apple TV, not to mention that it seems a lot faster than the original model.  They've added Netflix which is nice, letting me access this content without having to switch over to my Roku box.Cloud content is where we're headed, and an Apple TV gives to a great way to take advantage of that, provided you're purchasing content from them.  For Amazon content, you'll need a different box, such as the Roku.It's a breeze to set this unit up, you'll be up and running within minutes.This is a great product for cord cutters.July 15th:  Update.... I just discovered the Airplay feature on this unit, which allows me to stream content from my iPhone or iPad, such as YouTube videos, or items in my iTunes library, making this device even more useful....",

However, they keep adding new iPads, etc but they refuse to bring the App Store or any real app ecosystem to the Apple TV.While it is a far more polished experience than Roku (which I also have), they need more apps.  Obviously they can handle an app ecosystem based on their success with iOS apps and the Mac App Store on OS X but they choose not to with Apple TV.If you use iTunes a lot (I would say I'm more on the music side, and have iTunes Match) and like to use AirPlay from your devices, this is still a killer product.  But I'd love to see more apps.Also, this is a far better option than using other devices like your gaming system.  I used to use my Xbox all the time for this type of media but Apple TV is far less power hungry and I feel that any long use of Xbox is just that much time spent moving closer to hardware failure so I save that time for gaming on it.",

If you purchased a movie on your computer, the APPLE TV allows you to watch it streaming into your TV. Requires internet in broadband capacity to really enjoy this product. Lets you watch Netflix and Hulu as well as Youtube and show flickr dot com slide shows. It has other features yet to tapped in and we are excited to say our household purchased two of these downstairs and upstairs. Apple TV is great to connect your iPad and iPhone to show on TV from different room to share with others and could be used in business situation to show your product video pulled from any youtube account and get the URL from iPhone or iPad while on wifi environment to display directly onto APPLE TV.

So we use them for playing our own content, streaming shows and movies from Netflix and other outlets, and displaying photos.

The tech is proven and intuitive. If you've used an iPhone iPad or iPod touch you will figure this out in seconds. Those are some of the reasons I've given it 5 stars.You can get sports subscription streams, Netflix and Hulu plus, all require subscriptions. I'm unsure of amazon prime. I've read that there isn't an app but there is a workaround using amigos device and airplay.I use streaming apps quite a bit and even though I have cable uverse with all the pay channels I still find myself watching streaming media at home. I like being able to quickly find and watch a movie I want without any additional hook ups or hardware.When family or friends visit I like to stream a folder of pictures, maybe from the last holiday we spent together, maybe from an adventure, he'll maybe you enjoy the kinds of pictures that aren't appropriate for everyone. You can quickly separate your shots into folders or albums and share just the album you want with your guests on a nice tv screen. Beats passing your iphone around to everyone.Based on apple being the dominant force in streaming, media, streaming media and media streams I would recommend this over similar boxes. None at this point will fully replace the cable experience but if you subscribe to Hulu plus and Netflix you can watch most or all of your shows within a day or two of airing for under $20/month.",

It is so easy to use. It works flawlessly. The interface is brilliant compared to what comes on our Vizio TV set. If I want to stream music over apple tv, I just open up iTunes and click on the AirPlay button. Same goes for photos and vidoes, etc. The only annoyance is that I have not been successful in getting Amazon videos to work. I can hear the audio, but the video does not show. I use my ipad or iphone as a remote. Great system, better than V Beam, which stopped working two OS upgrades back.",

You can't watch an entire season in sequence (without going back to the menu and selecting the next episode).  I think that could really be improved with a \"Play All\" button or \"Play in Sequence\" or something like that.  We have to figure out what episode is next and which we already watched and it is just a tad annoying.We also use a second unit all the time in our photography studio to share photos from our Mac to a large screen TV for clients.  It would work equally well for showing photos off to visitors and family!",

Go to Apple's website to see all the content available, but needless to say, it is fully-loaded, and getting content updates regularly. Pair this with a Mac, iPhone or iPad and you have endless possibilities. I use an Apple TV in my office as a wireless monitor.

Using iTunes Match you can play your songs anywhere.

It does cover the major channels like netflix,hulu,etc and best of all you can order movies cheaper then your current cable provider!. The key thing you must have is a great internet provider and a good wireless server to prevent any lag issues. I love mine and best of all I can unplug the unit if the kids have the tv and watch it on another tv in another room. It's a Apple so you know it's quality is outstanding!",

I just set itunes to load minimized during startup on our htpc upstairs in our living room and have this box in the basement family room. It allows me to watch any movies from our htpc library, listen to music files, view all of our photos and stream netflix. It will stream even more stuff but nothing else that I use. It streams blueray content without a hiccup over our n wifi. Well worth the price compared to a roku which we had because it does so much more. May not be great if you don't have a computer with a lot of files you want to be able to view in another room but for us its perfect.",

Both of these features offer multiple options for programming and accessibility, but the best, totally cool feature is AIRPLAY! Using this simple to access mirroring feature we have been able to share the wide world of apps from our iPhones and iMac and send the display straight to the tv screen.

Also, it appears that an infrared button (attached for better remote connection) was at fault. A gummy substance from the fastener had gummed up the devices eye. Having removed the eye and doing a thorough cleaning of the face, along with the reset has helped dispose of the problem. Netflix off of this device is a great have for me. Be advised that Amazon's version of streaming is not available. Beating iTunes pricing on movies makes this understandable. A new blue ray box will get me around this eventually.

I had high hope for it but I'm really disappointed. I love how you can use your iPad or your mac to control the device. But a lot of the time, the sound and the movement of the picture are out of sync. It does what I call &#34;kick back&#34; which means it kicks the picture off of the TV and back to the PC or iPad MANY times throughout watching a program. So that I have to &#34;send&#34; the picture or program back to the Apple TV. Sometimes, the sound does not come through at all, at which point I have to either unplug the device or reboot my computer. I had really hoped this was going to perform much better. At time I just hate it. I do also have a Google Chromecast in another room. I notice that the Chromecast works PERFECTLY with my iPad, but not so much with my Mac PC, however, at 1/3 of the price of the Apple TV, at this point, I will be using Chrome to expand to other TVs in my home. No way will I purchase another Apple TV until/unless these issues are resolved.",

    "reviewText": "To be honest, this is being written on a year-old Macbook Pro. I also own an iPhone, a Time Capsule, an OG Apple TV... and between myself, significant other, and the friend crashing on my couch, the number of fruit-based electronic devices in my household currently numbers at... ten? Eleven? Fact is, I might be slightly biased.But! Another fact is this gadget may finally be the thing that convinces me that we're living in The Future. And why is that, you ask?AirPlay.See, the thing is that Apple has pretty much nailed the concept of dead-easy streaming to the big screen mounted on the wall (just like yuppies!). This has kind of changed my life. I consider myself, if not an audiophile, then at least an audio appreciator, and love and cherish my vintage, freshly re-foamed JBL loudspeakers. I have managed to basically make my entire A/V setup disappear from my living room as a result of this little box. I plugged a chip-amp in behind those speakers, and then just started using AirPlay. For everything. Soon, I'll have the ATV mounted behind the TV and poof! That's it! If I want to listen to a CD (yeah, I have a CD collection) then I'll pop it in the laptop and beam it over. Same with a DVD. Or radio from my phone. I select the ATV and those JBLs start pumping.And it gets even more exciting when someone has photos to show us or a spontaneous YouTube-off. All of it just goes straight to the TV, reliably, no fuss - just the occasional compression artifacts faintly audible.And that's the thing. It's not perfect. It's wireless, so I'm not wringing the ultimate in audio quality out of my ones and zeros. It's mostly a dumb box, requiring I have my laptop open if I want to listen off of my iTunes library, or buy things ala carte off the iTunes store more often than I intended to. I also really really wish I could add services to it. And honestly, if you're not as brand-centric as I somehow became, it's probably won't be so magical (what with AirPlay being proprietary and all). But it does 1080p, and has been the the trigger to completely upend my attitudes and behaviors surrounding media consumption and my home. I watch more videos. I listen to more music. I present things to my friends and learn more as a result. And that's not bad for the little black hockey puck once known as Apple's forgotten side project.TL;DR - I own a lot of Apple product, so this fits perfectly with my life in The Future, full of streaming and robots that fold my laundry. Might make less sense if you own disparate electronics. I'd say to throw one in the cart next time you buy a Mac.",

    "reviewText": "To start with, let me note that I am primarily a Netflix and iTunes user. I started out with a very nice Roku 2XS which worked just fine out of the box, detected and connected to my network, and functioned exactly as it was supposed to. Then... I realized my iTunes library was completely inaccessible and realized I'd made a mistake. So I ordered the Apple TV from Amazon. Here are my observations:1) The fit, finish and packaging for this most inexpensive of Apple's products is as good as anything else Apple makes. It does not appear like a stepchild in Apple's product line. It is an extremely tactile, compact, weighty little device with clean lines and is a perfect physical match for my new flat screen.2) The user interface is far and away superior to that for the Roku or any other similar device I've tried. Some thought has gone into their software for this device and it's the most usable in its class.3) The \"channel\" selection through AppleTV continues to grow, and so far as I can tell, this item offers more options that the Roku.4) The Airplay connectivity with my wireless PC works as expected. It's a very pleasant experience to find your complete iTunes media library accessible directly on your set without being forced to connect yet more cabling. I have a 2Wire router from AT&T; and the performance is easily good enough for high-def movies and TV shows. This is the main reason I went with this device. I am quite satisfied. I can now see new episodes of \"Justified\" and \"Mad Men\" when they come out on iTunes the day after the episodes air. You can't get everything in the most timely manner through iTunes (Game of Thrones? Hello? HBO?) but this is a large chunk of a good solution for people like me who refuse to subscribe to cable.I would eventually like to see Apple manufacture another version of this product with a 2-3 TB hard disk. I would absolutely consider buying such a device given that they can be trusted to put thought and design into the software to really make it work.",

If you have Apple devices (iPhone/iPad/iPod), this is perfect because it lets you watch videos that you normally would watch on your small mobile device screen, and puts it on your TV via AirPlay. Think of it as hooking up your computer to your TV via a HDMI cord but only it's wireless!I use it all the time because I like controlling my Netflix, Hulu Plus, etc on my iPad because it is so much easier to search and select on your iPad (compared to TV or gaming console apps), but it's much nicer to watch on a big screen TV. That alone is worth the price of the device.On top of AirPlay, it allows you to sync and get content from your iTunes library. Not to mention the every growing apps that come standard on Apple TV (although keep in mind most apps require you to pay for the service). My favorite free app is VEVO. When you have guests over, I generally just pick a genre and it's nice to have background music playing with the music video to match. Let's be real - we all miss watching music videos!

By comparison, I can watch 720p Netflix with no delays at all.Another plus of the Apple TV is that the UI and remote are so easy to use, this is the first time my 76-year-old dad is using Netflix all by himself. I also have a PS3, but he always asked me to turn it on and play the TV show he wanted. He would not dare use Netflix on the PS3 by himself.

I doubt that one person can watch everything in one lifetime.  I'm catching up on a lot of shows that I've heard about but never really watched before.  You can watch the whole series in order without commercials.  We really like the standup comedy shows too!  We have cable internet service so our connection is very fast but the streaming still lags behind from time to time - granted it's a wireless connection so perhaps it's the microwave or garage door opener interfering with it, but other than that annoyance, we're completely happy with it and we'll likely buy a second unit for our bedroom TV.",

Very easy to set up, although there are occassional glitches and the device has to be set up. The optical connect to the stereo system is easy, and sound guality is great. We were amazed at the number of internet radio stations, and the ease of streaming directly off our ipad, mac or iphone --- just use airplay. Makes it easy to download a video from itunes and then play it through our home stereo system. One of our most recent surprises with music is we are enjoying the Rhapsody music service, $10 a month, and with airplay we can stream directly to out stereo system. Little quirks are the remote -- make sure you follow the steps to ensure your laptop isn't picking up the apple tv. Also we have slow internet, so downloading movies via apple tv is too slow to stream -- instead we download to the laptop and use airplay to watch on the TV. Just a great device for a great price.",

I'm very pleased with the Sony for what it does.  But it's what the Sony doesn't do that caused me to want the Apple TV - I still have to watch ESPN 3, and non-Netflx/Hulu Plus streaming sites on my iMac - which is fine, but isn't in as comfortable a location as my TV is...The combination of the Apple TV and my iMac now means that by using Airplay Mirroring, I can watch anything streaming on my computer directly on the TV - which is just what I wanted.  Oh and we can also display whatever my wife is streaming on her iPhone directly on the TV.Purchasers do need to check the spec of their hardware though.  If you have an apple computer from before 2012, check the compatibility list on Apple's web site, to see if airplay mirroring will work for you.  If airplay mirroring won't work for you, and you don't intend to update your hardware, you may want to look at the Roku (no you-tube option to date) or another streaming device, which has more \"in the box\" streaming options than the apple TV has.However, for me and any other Apple devotees, this is the streaming device you want to attach to your \"un-smart\" TV (and possibly your smart TV as well).",

    "reviewText": "We have a Sony Smart TV but often times we would have issues with our Netflix connectivity.  I assumed it was our DSL, but our computers and phones weren't having issues on the wifi, so I wondered.  I decided to purchase this AppleTV because I also wanted to listen to the music on my phone through the stereo without tethering my phone via a cable.  I am SO glad I purchased this as our main Christmas gift to our family from &#34;Santa.&#34;  It took one use to realize all the issues we had been having with Netflix and YouTube were due to our TV, not our DSL.  Now we can watch Netflix and YouTube all night long on our TV with the AppleTV with no issues at all.Using it for playing music from my phone hasn't worked out as well.  When doing so, it often cuts-out, there's popping or it'll just drop the connection.  It's so frustrating, I've just gone back to listening to the music on my phone via a cable. Oh well...it's not everything I wanted, but it's still pretty darn good.  I also wish you could use Amazon Prime on it, but again, oh well.Our set-up:  we connected to our AppleTV to our Sony Receiver via HDMI cable and of course the TV is connected to the receiver via HDMI.  It works great!",

I haven't really tried a lot of the other functions (Netflix etc.), but it does exactly what I bought it for.",

We use it mostly for Netflix streaming and the picture is extremely good. One of my favorite features, however, is Airplay. If your computer supports Airplay (newer Macs do), you can stream anything from your computer wirelessly to the TV - no cables needed. There is little or no degradation of the picture - you can stream movies, photos, music - if it's on your computer screen, you will see it on the TV. And there's no set-up involved - simply set your TV to Apple TV input and click the Airplay icon at the top of your computer screen. Whatever your computer screen is showing will also be on the TV. Additionally, you can set the sound to come from the TV sound system not your computer's. I was skeptical at first because we don't have the fastest internet connection and I thought the picture when streaming a video would be choppy but wasn't at all.

Setup with itunes cloud we play our own music collection off of the apple TV a lot, but many times we are having issues with the connection it took days, maybe even weeks before all of our library was available on the AppleTV. I think this is an itunes cloud issue and not a hardware issue. Applications for youtube isn't up to its best performance yet. Sometimes downloading itunes movie rentals or purchases gets stuck if the broadband internet connection isn't performing at top speed. Just for us, we found that Hulu plus isn't that great for providing additional options to Netflix. We use the mirroring for iphone and ipads every now and then but manytimes just using an hdmi cable direct between the iphone, ipad or laptop to the TV screen's hdmi port is many times the better option.the remote control for the AppleTV still has a lot to be desired---is quite small and hard to control even with my smaller female hands, but my husband and teen sons don't like the small size. Even i feel like the remote control is going to fall out of my hands while I use it. The controls are pretty basic, and I must see primitive. A keyboard would be a nice add-on option especially for the simple task of keying in words for searches, rather than toggling from letter to letter with the up-down-left-right RC buttons. Are you listening, Apple? (Wait! as per E.J.'s almost immediate comment, there is a free Remote Control app for the iphone and ipad that you can use with the Apple TV. I just tried it and it is a handy remote control alternative that I am still getting used to, BUT i really like tapping searches in for itunes, movies, netflix and youtube instead of toggling for letters. Highly recommend using it with Apple TV now. Thank you, E.J., for the tip)So lots of 3rd-party factors going on for the AppleTV to perform to its max, but we don't regret cutting our cable TV off and saving 70% off of our ATT Uverse bills!I read up on jailbreaking the AppleTV to get more content on this thing, but I am looking forward to a paradigm shift for smart TV so that more content will be made available through this medium.",

We can turn the subscription on and off through iTunes.  Theinterface for Netflix and Hulu Plus is similar.  It looks like services like this work the same with the Apple TV vs. having apps that have completely different interfaces.  Youtube works well and the radio is nice also.  It's excellent.  The interface is really clean.  Setup is dead simple.  It seamlessly integrates other Apple devices.It also integrates with our iPads and iPhones.  Having it work with other Apple devices is surprisingly useful.  We airplay from these devices to the TV all the time.  We use this for Pandora, video clips that we come across from web pages, etc.  It's nice to put those up on the TV to show the family.  You can mirror screens as well.I have to say that it's cool to start watching something on the iPad (e.g. a Netflix documentary) and then resume on the Apple TV later on.  I do this all the time.  I start watching something on the iPad, maybe while the kids are using the TV.  Then when they're done I resume on the TV.  That's more of a Netflix thing than an Apple TV feature but obviously it all works together nicely and I want to mention it for those who are considering this kind of setup.We use the remote app to control the Apple TV and that works really well.  Also, the screen saver for the TV will pull from your photo stream so when we take a picture it immediately shows up on the TV's screen saver and photo stream,  Having access to everything you buy with iTunes is very nice.The remote that Apple provides is not bad.  I've seen reviews that complain about it.  It's small, yes.  But it's very functional and we make sure to put it on the coffee table or an end table when we aren't using it so that it doesn't get lost.  It doesn't allow you to control the sound on the television.  That would be a nice feature to add.Like any Apple device it automatically updates its software periodically when new versions are available.  It's very user friendly.Lastly, we used this setup plus a Winegard FreeVision TV antenna to eliminate cable TV.  We're *very* pleased.  My wife was a skeptic and pleaded to drop the idea.  I kept cable while we tried this and then I let her decide.  Our deal is that she can allocate the savings from cable to something else that we need (for the kids or the house).  She loves the new setup now that she's tried it.  The kids absolutely love it and thanked me for getting them Apple TV.  It's really about the entire system but they like how Apple TV organizes kids shows by character.  They flip through and then find new shows to watch.Buy it.",

You can also rent through iTunes, which though I thought I wouldn't use, I've rented just about a movie a week since purchasing Apple TV.Also, MLB, NBA, and NHL packages are available, however, there are blackout restrictions based on the location of your internet provider, so if you're a fan of local teams, these may not be worth it.In closing, buy Apple TV, it's worth it.",

This device does a fantastic job.The only con I have about the device is the \"apple sharing\" feature whereby you can link your iphone/ipad to the apple tv to playback videos/pics you have taken.  While the pictures look fantastic and load quickly, the videos on the other hand take forever to load.I heard to mitigate this problemm, once should be connected to the interned over a wired connection as a oppose to wi-fi.  This really is not a option for me, so I guess I will have to live with this issue.",

So when I got Apple TV for  a gift I was very excited to say the least.  I have been messing around with my Apple tv but I don't really understand what Apple TV is. You can get Netflix but you have to pay for it. I can get netflix through my DVD player or go to red box, so why get Apple tv. It has an HBO app, but you need to be paying for HBO to use it, and I can access the same stuff it offers through ONDEMAND with my cable provider. Again, I dont need AppleTV to get what it offers. It has Youtube, again, I don't need appletv to watch youtube videos. It offers shows, which again you have to pay for and I can get from my cable provider, usually for free. It has ESPN, again I don't need APPLETV to watch ESPN.I am sure for tech people, they can sync their ipad and their macs with Apple TV and do wonderful things, but for me, I don't  see what it offers really. Netflix and youtube videos?I am still totally searching for the point of having AppleTV.",

    "reviewText": "First off, I absolutely hate Apple's possessiveness when it comes to EVERYTHING.  You buy a movie or a song through iTunes and you don't fully own it and can't do with it what you please.  However, buy the same item off of Amazon and it is yours - no strings attached.  You can share it with a friend or open it in another application.  No problem at all.That said, we immediately didn't like that the Apple TV does not have the ability to add \"apps\" like the Amazon app one for movies and rentals.  We'd much rather support their business model than be tied to Apple!  I get how this is in direct competition with iTunes / Apple but not having the choice is annoying when you'd rather own things you buy.  It's not a library book with strings attached!  If I bought the same DVD, book or CD at a store I could give it to a friend when I was done with it!  We also were disappointed in the lack of a Pandora app.  Sure, I could use Airplay from my iPad or iPhone but to have to change the setting every time on that device and not be able to create Pandora stations from the TV or thumb up/down songs from there was too many steps.I generally don't like homesharing because my base PC NEVER stays on (and why would it?  It's a waste of power...) and it was impossible to set up multiple accounts on the Apple TV (through two PCs).  I read somewhere that Apple makes it look like it is doable to set up more than one but never fully implemented it.  Then I tried to get BOTH of our iDevices set up to act as remotes.  I got one easily enough but could never get the second one working.  These are things that should be simple and Apple makes you THINK you can do them... but wow...  maybe not without a heck of a lot of research and tweaking!Sure, the photostream is cool and the interface slick and I'll miss those things but are they worth it?  Are we getting our money's worth?  Most importantly, can we easily do the things that we want to without having to spend hours googling to see if what we want to do is even doable?  The answer, for us at least, is NO.  So after two months with this thing, and still too many questions and frustration, we are returning it and getting a Roku 3 instead.",

However, having lived with it for more than a week, I find the Roku to be a much better alternative.  If you are already into the Apple Eco-system, then hands down this is the product for you.  Air Play was cool too.  However, I was looking for free content and new Roku has a similar function as AirPlay.  Not much freebies on Apple TV except Podcast.  The content on Podcast was spotty at best.  If it's more up-to-date, it might have been OK.  Another complain is that the unit would freeze up after a few program searches.  I had to reboot the unit every time I use it.  As a result, loosing all my user profiles and log in info, including re-entering wifi info.  I could not recommend this product based on my experience.  Bottom line:Pro - If you already subscribe to the whole Apple Eco-system, you already have you content there.  AirPlay.Con - Not a lot of free content, unit freezes up.",

From a functionality standpoint, the Apple TV is my least favorite.APPLE TVPros: The design, reliability and ease of use and general \"fit and finish\" is the clear leader of the bunch. Being able to stream some of the content on my Ipad and Iphone is also a cool bonus.CONS:The google TV acts like an Android Phone, you can add apps. Unlike the Google TV, you can not add APPS to the Apple TV and are left with the very limited selection of built-in applications. I can't stream my Amazon Videos, Can't Browse The web, Pandora is not native and the list goes on.  (Unless I am on my Ipad)and the selection is just plain poor.There is no USB port where I can connect an external HD and play media off of it. Both my RoKu and Google TV do this and I use it all the time.I can not connect to my NAS server in the house. Both my RoKu and Google TV instantly see the share and I can stream all the movies and songs that I have on my 3TB master NAS which holds all these things. Although my NAS is an \"itunes\" server... the only way to stream videos to an Apple TV is to connect to a PC or Mac which is running and logged into Itunes. If I wanted to keep my laptop powered on all the time, this would not be an issue but I don't.In summary, I think the features and functionality of the Apple TV is very limited. It should work like an Iphone or Ipad and support apps just like Google TV does, they should add some USB support and start making NAS products which are compatible with it.",

It can be infuriating when your ATV's AirPlay doesn't work properly, but I have found that shutting it down (put to sleep) or unplugging as a silly, but effective troubleshooting method. I'm not going to comment on Hulu, Netflix, etc. as I have other devices I use for this. I would like to see apps for Amazon Prime and others. More apps in general would be nice (here's hoping for a jailbreak). Also, if your Mac is mid-2011 or older you can't use AirPlay to mirror your screen.",

    "reviewText": "I passionately dislike Apple and the way it does its &#34;iLife&#34;. However, this was a gift for family that already had an iPad so the mirroring idea is what sold it the most in reality.A HUGE thing to mention here is that the controlling momma Apple does not allow any other apps to be installed onto the device. Whatever Apple chooses to install or remove during an update is what you will get and you will have no say in the matter. Why do I say this? Well...do you have Amazon Prime so you can watch tv and stuff???...not on the Apple TV you don't!!The control leaves much to be desired. It is also NOT a bluetooth control so you must keep a clear shot to the device for the control to work.On the plus side, the looks of the device is sleek and classy. It blends very well and does not take up much space at all. The setup (I am pretty technically inclined) was a breeze. Connecting was equally easy (HDMI).Reliability: Cannot attest to any of it as the device has barely been used still. I hope Apple still takes pride in the products and demands the high level of quality it did when Mr. Jobs was still in charge.Disclaimer:I am extremely bias in support of the Android platform. I use Samsung devices (SmartTV, Smartphones) and they all connect together wonderfully, the TV let's me install extra apps (on top of the pre-installed ones). I have used one of the many Google TV devices and those also allow you to do what any Android tablet can do.Final words: I think that for the money, you could find something more competitive with more flexibility. I personally would never purchase this device for personal use. If you are already submerged into the iLife, however, then this device is neat simply because you can mirror some other apple devices onto the tv with this (play a game without having to have the phone 5 inches from your face!!)",

You are unable to have those options either ....However the &#34;airplay&#34; works great using my macbook or IPhone as remotes for certain HULU or NETLFIX shows !! There are other amazing options with being able to transfer data wirelessly (everybody hates cords).  As long as you understand what your buying it can be a great addition to any entertainment center.",

My first experiences using it to rent iTunes movies was less than spectacular, with lots of delays and freezing and buffering.  I did buy a movie and have a slightly better experience in that use.  I probably won't use it much for that purpose, especially for movies that are very involving, where a sudden freeze and buffer would ruin the experience!For streaming photos from iPhone, it is fantastic.

    "reviewText": "Last year I bought A Roku and was looking forward to all of the channels I could add and watch and even though there are more than I could ever watch I thought it was a great concept. I also bought the Roku mainly for Netflix and HBO GO which are both native apps. Then I found out that DirecTV does not support the Roku's HBO GO app which was frustrating, to say the least.Anyway, on to the Apple TV.Setup was a breeze and Apple never disappoints in the ease on navigating around the menu. I immediately configured my Logitech Harmony One remote to work with it (which went flawlessly) and I was ready to go. (The Apple TV remote is so tiny I was afraid it would get lost). Using my Harmony One remote on the Roku (even though it works) was a clunky, lag fest and very frustrating to use.After configuring the Apple TV I tried Netflix and the picture quality was great, I think better than the Roku as well as the Netflix Menu which is much more user friendly on the Apple TV.Then I tried streaming the movie Battleship on HBO GO from my iPad via Airplay and even though it took a min or two to start, the picture quality was much better than I expected and dare I say BluRay quality.Even though the Apple TV doesn't have anywhere close to the amount of channels that the Roku does, it's a top quality product which once again shows that Apple is the best in the business and being able to listen to my iTunes library through my home theater is awesome.HBO is currently working on a native App for HBO GO on the Apple TV so that will be the icing on the cake but for now, watching over Airplay is solid.Very happy with this purchase.",

I thought airplay and screen mirroring would be the way to go.  Little did I know Amazon and Apple are having a stand-off because Apple can't handle competition.  Well, I'm sorry Apple, but in my opinion, Amazon's services are better than your's and Netflix' combined.  In the meantime, I'll use my dinky little Wii to watch Prime content in non-HD.Seriously Apple, get over it and quit suing everyone for everything.Please hold while I step down from my soapbox.... Okay, on a positive note.  This thing is incredibly easy to use, I watch my video podcasts effortlessly, and video rentals are actually quite reasonable.  Also, I really like the ability to stream music from my PC (using iTunes) and have a slideshow screensaver display on my TV (from a specific folder that I chose on my computer).  Screen mirroring is pretty cool, but I haven't found much practical use for it.It was a toss-up between this and the Roku, and I'm glad I got the Apple TV.Good hunting...",

If you have other Apple products, make purchases from the iTunes store, etc it brings all of that to your TV and stereo setup in a simple manner.  It automatically gives us access to our iTunes purchased content, we use AirPlay to stream music from our Synology diskstation, use our TV to show photos and videos we've taken on our phone, etc.  It brings everything together nicely.The big issue I've had is that updates frequently break it.  A recent update has caused network issues.  Each day I have to reboot the device to get network connectivity and AirPlay to work.  It's like every night it forgets how to network.  I tried fixing this by reseting the system to factory settings, but that only made it happen less frequently.  Also, all of the content you purchased in iTunes must be verified with an online server before it will play.  I've been unable to access my purchased content on two different occasions because of the server going down.  Perhaps I just happened to find the two outages in the past year, or (more likely) this happens rather frequently.Overall, I recommend getting it if you have a lot of iDevices and iContent.

Now with the hdmi adapter I can have the video go out through the cable and have the audio sent to my blu tooth headphones. With the apple TV it is all or nothing. If you send the video to the tv you have to send the audio there as well.

I'm no novice to technology and I followed the prompts carefully, but could not get the Apple TV to recognize my iPad even though both showed up on the same WiFi. I searched the Apple website and internet for troubleshooting tips (not very useful) and ended up just trying as many things as I could think of, including starting over, shutting down, etc. I can't explain why, but it suddenly worked. I then attempted to set it up on a different WiFi in a different location, with the same results (long period of trial and error, followed by sudden connection after starting over, shutting down, etc.). Next came a different TV on the same WiFi, with yes, the same results. This is a pretty cool product, but my advice if you plan on using it for anything important is to set it up well in advance and leave it connected. No telling how long it will take.",

We hooked it up via an adapter to an older analog TV which does not do it justice. Pictures are pretty good, but text on the older TV is blurry.

The apps were slow and clunky and the video quality was worse.  The home screen is full of stuff I don't want on my home screen (that's very very minor, though).  The Apple TV only works on wifi, so despite being 1 foot from my router and having an Ethernet port it still had to be wireless.  Not sure why they won't just let it work on the Ethernet port.  But airplay only worked (the little it worked) on wifi.Netflix is something we use daily.  We both hated the app on Apple TV.  Slow and clunky.Same for crunchy roll.I didn't notice an Amazon instant video app, so that means we still need the PC.I'd have still kept it if airplay worked well.  But it didn't.  In fact airplay got netflix to work ONCE.  After that it didn't work again.  I wasted my one use on Red Dwarf.  (The holoship episode).Sadly that was also the case for airplaying my display from the Air.  It worked one time after trying half a dozen times.  That one time it was not impressive, the display was in a window on screen.  At no time did the display scale and fill the screen so it was too small to really see.  I tried it a dozen times after that and it didn't work again.  The Air would try and try.  A couple times the Apple TV went black but didn't display the Air screen.What was cool is that my TiVo came up when I tried to airplay one time.  I will have to check that out.  The letters wore off my TiVo remote so I couldn't get my password punched in, but I'm intrigued.  If I can airplay to my TiVo I really don't need Apple TV.I wanted to love it as much as I f'n love this ipad Air, but I couldn't.  It just isn't ready to replace a PC plugged the tv.  I want to give it two stars, but I realize that not everyone has a PC or the layout for that to work.  If I didn't have a PC I'd have probably loved it, even without the airplay. I'd have said 4 stars in that case.  Hey diddle diddle, a three.",

Wonderfully downloadable from the Apple app-store is the \"remote\" program such that I can with my Ipad or Iphone do quick and easy searches on youtube or netflix quickly and wonderfully scrolling thru the screen and using a genuine though small keyboard on the ipad and iphone;  however if you are not the owner of said device(s), you will find Apples typical insane thuggery and near-perverse dedication to packaging its products in the smallest oragami sized packaging possible along with equally small and form over function (vs. ideal form following and mirroring/mating with function) hardware.Such is the case of the Apple TV remote, which is creepy to hold, thin as a bookmark, and feeling (to the blind) like holding a surgical knife, and having only 3 buttons, of which if you want to do a search on your wifi network for youtube vids etc etc. you will scream havoc and damnation upon the heads of Apple for making what I'm sure they thought at the time as a \"cute understated and 'hip' looking remote control\".Answer would have logically have been to include a touch sensitive pad to the top of the remote as the Apple magic mouse has and a $5 HDMI cable and charge $20 more for the unit package to cover the hardware production costs to the enduser to accommodate those who, unlike myself, are not monastic devotees to Apple and its array of products. I own 18 Apple products and have branded my body permanently with its corporate logo and advocate heavily for its OS and computers, as such I feel both logically and with evidences from experience in use of this product, to not only cry foul upon this absurdity of user-interface insanity, but proof of my dedication to Apple Inc. and not be, as there are out there, many Apple-phobics/haters. Dont buy this product unless you ALREADY own another Apple-created search tool (iphone or ipad). Searches and typing with this remote are an utterly insane non-starter; all the more so important since many buy this as a web portal video search interface for their TV.",

I spent $99 on my Apple TV and $55 on my Sony BluRay player, and if I had to give one up, I'd give up my Apple TV. The BluRay player lets you access everything the Apple TV does and much, much more including your Amazon purchases. The only thing the BluRay player doesn't have is iTunes, but that's something I can live with. In addition, you can also play BluRay discs and regular DVDs as well. The only pluses the Apple TV has are that it has a smaller footprint and the interface is more attractive, but I have plenty of room and as long as it does what it's supposed to do, I don't care what the menu looks like. Like Apple TV, you can also control the BluRay player using the TVSideView app on your iPhone. I love Apple products, but save your money and get more bang for your buck with a BluRay player with wifi instead of this.",

I own a PS4 and PS3, so I already have access to the majority of the apps.  However, the ESPN app was unavailable to me because I guess MS is paying to keep that app off Sony consoles.  Me being a sports fan, I had to have ESPN.  So I purhcased an Apple TV.What I loveThe design.  This box is tiny.  It takes up no space. Set up was very simple and easy.  Understand to activate ESPN and HBOGo you're going to need go on their websites and enter a code.  The picture is great and the airplay feature is kinda cool.What I'm not so in love withThe remote.  It's friggin small and begging to fall into the couch vortex.What I'm disappointed with:Airplay.  There are a few apps that aren't available on apple tv that are available on my ipad and I was really hoping I could mirror what's on my ipad to my tv (like watching the TNT app on my tv).  Unfortunately, you can't do this for whatever reason.  You can mirror photos, music, games, etc...but not certain entertainment apps.Overall, I'm happy.  I got what I wanted. ESPN!!!!

    "reviewText": "This is a tuff review because it depends on how you are reviewing it.  If you are reviewing it as a upgrade to the 720p appletv, then it can't be anything but negative.  if it's about the device in general, there are real positives about it.  My score reflected the upgrade route.  In general, you may hardly ever get to that point where the 1080p upgrade is noticeable.Your mileage with appletv is going to be dependant on your adherance to the IOS environment.  If you are a massive investor into purchasing/renting from the itunes environment, this device is absolutely fantastic.  also, if you are heavy into the ios environment with other devices, the airplay feature can potentially be very nice.  I like the fact that past digital movies activated via past dvd/blu ray disc purchases are there available for streaming.  The negative is the stream you get is sd.  Conversely, if you did an ultraviolet digital movie from a dvd/blu ray purchase and that movie is available on vudu(the setup on this is convuluted), via a roku, xbox or ps3, you can get a hd 1080p digital stream.  on the airplay front, its convenient to be able to do that to the appletv but if its for a game, the resolution hit can get gross.  airplay is a ridiculously finicky piece of tech and even under the best of the best network environments, getting a great resolution is rare.  when compared to using a direct hdmi connection to an ios device, its night and day on the quality front.  I have gotten it to the point where it does look really good over airplay but compared to direct hdmi, no comparison.  and to even get it to that, took a bit of work.If you don't airplay or don't purchase much from itunes, you are probably buying this for netflix.  in this situation, buy the roku.  the roku is an app beast, you get amazon prime video, hbogo, vudu, and on and on....the app offering on the appletv is paltry at best.for me, it's a mixed bag.  I do airplay quite a bit.  Also, I am heavily invested in to flickr which is one of the rare apps the appletv does have.  I love controlling the appletv from my phone or ipad as we watch our family photos thru the appletv from flickr.  I also have the fortune of owning many other devices so I can get my app fill from my network smart tv, ps3, 360, etc so for me, what roku offers in spades as it's advantages, i get from other devices anyways.  it leaves the appletv as a great device for me from which to do so airplay gaming or browsing and flickr.It's an extremely limited device, if you fall within that tiny, tiny sphere, you are going to love it.  if not, way, way better purchases can be made.",

We got this apple TV for Christmas so we could stream netflix in our room (so the Xbox can stay in the family room) and so far it is not living up to the hype. We've had a lot of problems with the streaming quality and freezing up- every time we think we've solved the issue it happens again.My husbands biggest complaint is the remote, which is very small. Tiny, in fact. It's probably 3 inches long by about an inch wide. It's very hard to keep up with.My biggest complaint is that the netflix format/commands are different from the xbox version of netflix, which is more user friendly. I suppose this could be a netflix issue, but regardless if you are like us and have both -- it can be very frustrating. There is no &#34;play next episode&#34; option or auto play 3 in a row --every time an episode ends you have to go back two menus and scroll down to select a new episode. Maybe not a problem if you are just going to watch one movie, but if you want to watch multiple episodes of a season - it's annoying.Pros: Good price for streaming device (vs. another xBox 360), some cool features like photo-synching with iPhone and ability to watch Apple Movie Trailers.",

I paid Apple to resolve the issue and they were absolutely clueless. It was a total waste of money. I have tried every solution that was posted to fix this issue for few months now. Fortunately, I did not sell my WDTV Live boxes and I have now gone back to using them to play my content. Best thing about WDTV is that you don't need to convert the media in Apple readable format. Coming back to Apple TV, for me, its a paperweight at this point. I have run out of all the options and solutions. Home Sharing is a major function of ATV and it does not work as advertised.

I wanted to use the mirroring feature--wirelessly project whatever was on my laptop to the flat screen in my bedroom. It was easy to set up, but I tried to play a movie, and I could not get audio. I called Apple and they told me that my macbook air was probably not compatible, which was not true. Then I was told that my router was probably not powerful enough. (I just bought a time capsule so that was not it). I then was routed to technical, and talking to them, it sounded as if other people were having this issue. Final resolution was that I probably had some type of interference that was disrupting the audio. It turns out when I tried the apple tv in another room it did work, however the volume thru the flat screen TV is still supressed. Apple's final recommendation is that I connect the device with an ethernet cable. If I wanted to go that route I could just have connected my laptop the flat screen to begin with.",

Over the years, their interface between their products and iTunes has drastically declined and become more frustrating and buggy.This new Apple TV was bought to replace my old Gen 1 when the old one quit accessing the Apple Store due to a bug in the software (which Apple still has yet to fix!).  I get this new unit all set up and it's got a problem staying connected to my library.  Yes, my computer stays on all the time.  However, IF you let the Apple TV SLEEP - it WILL DISCONNECT & NOT RECONNECT until you shut off your computer and the Apple TV and re-boot.Apple leaves it's users to post hundreds of posts trying to get help from each other - rather than supporting their products personally.  It's alarming.  I'm seeing more and more of my friends switching to other products - especially phones (Android, Samsung, etc.).  I'm appalled that they'd switch - then I run into these issues.  Apple is slowly dying.  I'm sad that they are focused on the volume - rather than fixing & maintaining the products they already produce.Bottom line:While the new Apple TV is an improvement over the old - it's frustrating to keep connected and why bother having a power saving feature that you can't even use?  The price is right - but you get what you pay for!!  I paid $300 for my original Apple TV - and loved it - because even if you were disconnected - you had a hard drive full of content to play anywhere.",

My macbook pro retina (2013, Mavericks OS) mirrors with 1 to 2 second lag making it impossible to use as a mirrored or extended display.  It seriously will give you headaches to operate a cursor with this much lag.  Videos playing from websites lag horribly with terrible refreshing of HD content.  The audio quality is also degraded.  This issue is even further exacerbated using a macbook air (2013, Mavericks OS) and impossible for use.  It's even worse than remote access many encounter with IT departments.  Yeah, crazy.It's appalling that apple would market this feature.  It's the only reason I purchased it.  Now I have a 100$ glorified Netflix, HBO GO box.  YEAY!  It's like Netflix heaven at my place.  You can watch it on my PS3, PS4, my HTPC, and now this wonderful 100$ paperweight.Now about apple customer support.  Just terrible.  When I first brought up this issue they sent me to a troubleshooting page of iOS devices.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, they sent me to a troubleshooting page for iOS devices even though the problem was associated with a macbook pro and a macbook air. FFFUUUUU.......Then they blamed the router.  But wait for it. I had the best router possible from their recommendation.  What the fu....So then we hooked up the AppleTV AND Macbooks through ethernet directly to the router and still got terrible lag.  With a direct connection?? What?  This is Apple quality?  The same people that made the MacBook Retina made this garbage. Really?So then we tried another TV and two other monitors.  Yeah that was waste of my time.  All in all I lost around 4 hours and 100$ because Apple can't get their you know together.In conclusion this 100$ box of failure is worse than a 5$ HDMI cable.If you think I'm raging...well you're right.  That's all this box is good for, a good rage.  But in my defense this issue is all over their support forums with absolutely no solutions offered.  So I'm not the only one experiencing this issue.",

Now for the not so good: the extremely small, hard to hold remote control- lack of buttons. Entering your wifi password along with your Apple id and password is very difficult with this poorly designed remote. It is anything but fun. The Air Play feature is unstable. It just quits when it wants to. The Mirroring feature works great for your iPad 2,3 or iphone 4s only, until it decides to turn itself off.The app selection is much better now than when the product first came out BUT, if you're looking for free content, you will be disappointed.The bottom line, is that this product only exists to help Apple sell program content from the iTunes Store.Other than Amazon's good price and fast shipping, I really can't say anything else that is positive about Apple TV.",

Its the perfect compliment to my iphone and ipad.First off, i have many apple devices so i am more or less commited to the platform.However im getting dissapointed by where things are going with them-less about making computing easy, more about controlling and selling content.So i was disapointed to discover that Apple TV is really just a \"buy\" platform for iTunes now.With the new interface they've made all the sharing and viewing of content off your PC stuff really hard to find and manage.Basically the utility functionality of it is going away in favor of accelerating monetization for apple.Its great for on demand buying of content from apple, but I really dont need another electronic leech on my wallet.We decided to keep it because of the Airplay function.  Thats sort of worth the $99.Too bad. I also have a roku that i wont be getting rid of.  Roku with airplay and itunes connectivity would amazing.",

As you see below I was really frustrated but I couldn't believe that I should have the problems I was having since so many people gave it a 5 star rating and their reviews were expressing things I wanted with my Apple TV.  Well, I decide to go to the Settings-General-Reset and give it a try.  I did and much to my happy surprise it seems to be working without any buffering problems.  I was able to watch a show on PBS and a show on Netflix.  I'm going to try Airplay and keep my fingers crossed that it works.------------------------original---------------------I wasted $100.00 on this thing.  I was hoping to be able to Airplay from my iPad or Mac to the TV, well that doesn't happen.  What happens is every 10-15 seconds the thing stops to buffer another 10-15 seconds of viewing, you need a whole day to watch an hour show.  I'm blown away that this happens with an Apple product after all they aren't they suppose to be the \"best ?\".  I have Roku and I have no problems with buffering issues.  Save your money on this and get Roku instead and be happy not frustrated with Apple TV.",

No time messing with settings, or tweaking this or that, or having to update codecs, or any of that.  Everything just works.So, when it came time to ditch my cable, I thought this was the no brainer.Let me just save you the trouble, and tell you to take your $99, stick it back in your wallet, and go get something else.  Anything else.  Get a box of crayons and a notepad and make yourself a flipbook - because at the end of the day, you'll at least be able to watch it.Lets start with the crux of the problem - iTunes.  iTunes is a disaster.  It hasnt aged gracefully, and it really needs to give up the goat and allow something better to come along and replace it.  Call it iMedia, or iVids, or iDontGiveaRatsass what you call it - just dont call it iTunes. Because I (and I'm sure I'm not alone) will avoid it like the plague.Aside from completely destroying my folder structure after I specifically said &#34;NO&#34; to the reorganize my media option (still pissed about this) - it placed about 90% of my library all willy-nilly into a single &#34;not added&#34; folder.  Yeah.  About 500gb worth of songs/videos/etc in one folder, with no naming convention, and no way to play them in iTunes.Then, what it did add, it added about 3 copies of to my library.  And guess what - apple is obviously keenly aware of this problem because they created a &#34;handy&#34; option to show all duplicates.  And thats great, because it highlights all the duplicates so you can manually go through them, right click, delete, and hope you go the right one and dont wipe the file off your disk.  Super helpful apple, thanks!Oh, and it only plays MP4 videos.  And even then, even if all you have are MP4s, its VEERRRRYYY picky about which MP4s it will play.Its a joke.  Its useless.  I get a warning message about 10 times a day telling me to update the software, which has come up since I bought the damn thing, and yet every time I've tried it fails.  It spends about 20 minutes going through the whole process, reboots, and tells me it failed.  Every. Time.Seriously worst product ever.Apple, you've lost someone who was a BIG supporter.

Let me say this, my brother bought the Roku Streaming Player and loves listening to Pandora, but he pays for the service on top of his cable bill. Here is the truth about all these \"HYPED\" streaming TV devices...Ready...My brother thought, oh great, I can get rid of cable TV and not have the bills every month! Guess again, with any of these streaming media boxes, you pay per series or episode, do I need to say it again louder? YOU WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING YOU BUY USING THESE STREAMING DEVICES ON TOP OF YOUR CABLE BILL! You need cable TV and to say it louder, YOU NEED TO BUY EITHER THE MIDDLE OR TOP SPEED INTERNET PACKAGE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TELL YOU WHEN YOU PURCHASE THESE DEVICES THAT YOU NEED A HIGH SPEED CONNECTION TO STREAM THE CONTENT...DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES IS THE WORD FOR IT! All the streaming boxes are worthless, a fad, and will not survive! People, do not waste your money on any streaming device when you can use almost any Tablet, Notebook or Desktop Computer and do the same thing. If anything, spend an extra $100 and you get a full tablet in HD from Amazon! Buy the Kindle Fire HD Tablet by Amazon if you want streaming content but at least with the Kindle Fire HD, Amazon gives you a free tablet that the company is losing money on just to capture a good customer base! The Kindle Fire HD Tablet is a hands down winner above and beyond any of these streaming \"Falsely Hyped\" TV Boxes!F.Y.I. Mr. Jeff Bezos, your new TV Ad comparing the Kindle Fire HD to the Apple iPad is the best Ad I have seen in a long time! Your marketing department nailed Apple face to face, world-wide with that ad. IN fact, I wish the marketing department went one step further and actually showed more of what can be done with the Kindle Fire HD compared to the iPad with hardly any useful features. Folks, again, the Kindle Fire HD is feature rich! Spend the extra $99 to $100 and buy the Kindle Fire HD and let the so called streaming devices die a nice slow death.F.Y.I. - 2.19.2013Update on the Apple TV Boxes...The price is declining because people are starting to figure everything out! You do not need this box to stream anything as I said above in my post. All you need is a $100 CD Player with Wi-Fi and you can get all the streaming content, i.e. Amazon Streaming Content, Netflix, etc. The prices from what I have seen today are as low as $79 for this empty black box by Apple.",

People with HD TV's probably wouldn't need Apple TV at all, as most of those come with the TV, but this makes access easier.  It also comes with YouTube, and who wouldn't love watching \"Ghost in the Stalls\" on the big screen?I believe there's also a way to hook up an ipad to the box so I can have the contents of my ipad on the television.  I haven't gotten around to doing that yet, but it doesn't seem difficult and would make purchasing one of these worthwhile just for that.All in all, there are easier ways to gain access to what Apple TV provides, but it's still nice to have them all on one convenient box rather than having to fight Internet connections and all the other nonsense that goes with.",

The greatest thing about Apple TV is the wireless integration with an Apple phone or Tablet. As a streaming player however, I was not as impressed. I had both devices connected to different televisions in my home, so if I had a problem with one, I would go to the other and see if the same problem existed. On several occasions, the Apple Netflix would not connect (or would show an error) while the Roku connected every-time. Almost everything on the Apple requires a &#34;subscription&#34; (incurring additional costs) while the Roku offers many free viewing selections. (The food channels for recipes and the fitness channels for home workouts are awesome). Since Roku 3 allowed me to stream pictures, music and video from my apple devices, I made the final decision to send the Apple back. But with that being said, I do want to state again that I can see where it would be nice to actually have BOTH of these machines.

    "reviewText": "Apple means different things to different people.  I personally love apple products, but I don't live completely in the Apple ecosphere, meaning I have a windows laptop and use google for a lot.The major plus of this devise is Airplay!  I have a iPad, and iPhone, and I would say 85% of the time it works perfectly.  There are occasional hiccups getting it on the TV, content will randomly decide not to work on Airplay.  Overall I love this dongle technology stuff!I primarily use it to stream content from a NAS drive I have hooked up to my home network.  Of course the NAS drive has an iOS app which lets me Airplay it to my TV via the Apple TV.  Fantastic!The downside is that it's not an end all solution for television.  I dropped TV service completely so I've tried every other alternative, including watching TV shows through websites.  Netflix and other apps are supported here, but they don't have everything, so beyond that its out of my hands whether or not a website will let me Airplay to the Apple TV.  iPad mirroring is cool, but the aspect ratio is different so streaming full screen video isn't full screen on your TV (I don't like that).However if you're looking for TV solutions consider this: the average TV service is about $50 per month.  On Apple TV you can buy a full season of a TV show for about $30.  So in a year's time, you could own a full season of 20 different shows for the same $600 you would have spent on cable or dish.  I say that plus an antenna is good enough for me.  Of course you have to have good internet to make this work, so factor that in.",

Best thing is it's small and doesn't take up much space at all! all you need is a HDMI cord to connect it to your television because it's not included in the packaging!

Of course it's dependent on your wireless connection but everything I've watched so far has worked beautifully and picture is crystal clear. The new remote for the newest 2014 version is a little too small for my tastes but I'm getting used to it as well as the button layouts on it. For me, the real draw of Apple TV was to be able to stream my iTunes content to my hd TV. Again, I've had no issues at all and everything loads relatively fast(depending on connection). Lastly, another big draw is the AIRPLAY function which is pretty cool. This allows you to play whatever is on your iPad or iPhone on your tv through Apple TV. Comes in handy especially with apps that aren't available on the device like amazon instant video. And that's the one drawback of Apple TV, not enough apps available yet. It's got netflix and hbo go(which are the two big ones) but not much more. But something tells me that will change in the future.",

Who wants to pull out toy after toy and hear the complaining while we're talking and eating dinner and playing cards? So I took Apple TV with us.  The cables (two of them) and the box fit in a grocery bag.  I hooked it up to my in-laws TV and the kids watched cartoons and their junk while the grown ups did our thing.  After dinner I went on YouTube and played songs for my 75 year old father in-law that he hadn't heard in years, that he loved, etc. etc.  He loved it! Then we watched clips of sporting events on YouTube.  He loved them.Portable is a HUGE pro for this product.  Other products like the Roku will be portable as well but this is so easy to set up, so easy to use (my six year old can easily navigate the interface), and just so...great!Be advised that you'll need a HDMI cable.

    "reviewText": "Great product.  HOWEVER, a couple of useful tips:  You need a good wireless router, and, itunes should be your main storage source for your music, films, and photos if you want to fully utilize all the features this product has to offer.First, the router I had just didn't have the strength, so I got Apple's Airport Extreme which did a superb job.  Very few drops or buffering issues when streaming.Second, I love the features it has in regard to itunes - once you sync it with your itunes account, any movies, music, or photos you have on your computer can be streamed onto your TV with your Apple TV.  It also has a screen-saver feature which will &#34;slide show&#34; any picture collection you want to show up on your TV screen.  It also gives you multiple ways to present those photos in your screen-saver mode.You can also set up music files through itunes to play through you TV.  Very nice for dinner parties, holiday season, or just want to have music going on in your house while you do chores or whatever.It will only work for one TV so you will have to have an Apple TV for each television you want to stream on.  It does stream Netflix and Hulu Plus, but not Amazon.  It also has a &#34;movie-clips&#34; site from which you can view the latest movie promos.Overall, a very nice quality product - if you are committed to itunes.",

I put the Chromecast on one of the two HDMI ports on my TV and then Apple TV on the other while timing how long an one hour long episode in HD would take to start streaming.  Needless to say, Apple TV was exceptionally faster and appeared clearer without pixelation that was seen on the Chromecast.Bottom line for Apple users: you get what you pay for.

It works fantastic as a Roku style device, streams Netflix etc beautifully and has optical and HDMI output etc.Disappointment comes from a couple of things.  Mostly Airplay.  Airplay is awesome and works perfect from an iOS device, but is very sub par on my macbook pro.  We have a variety of movies in various formats on my computer and I have had to do a lot of messing with my router to try and make playback watchable.  Streaming TV from a website for example is borderline watchable with the jumpiness.  its like I am getting 5fps instead of 30.  Sometimes if hangs for a half second or so.  Doesn't seem like a big deal until you are trying to watch a show and its so distracting!I also wish I could do the &#34;private listening&#34; that the Roku offers.  I have watched a couple shows while my wife sleeps and it would be epic if I could listen from my headphones rather than the speakers.  You can't do it however, even with apps etc on your phone that say you can (at least  that I have found so far).The Roku Stick couldn't even hook to my wifi.  I get an excellent signal (checked with Air Radar mac app) right in front of my TV but the Roku was terrible.  I sent it back.  I have a Roku 2 on the way (previous was the stick) I hope it works better....",

I have liked it enough that I bought one for a relative whom I thought would enjoy it.I like being able to have all TV shows and movies purchased on my computer's iTunes immediately available to watch on my main entertainment system. I think in the past the Apple TV had a storage capacity but as far as I can tell this doesn't so much store things as instantly retrieve them from the iTunes store as soon as you ask for it.I have iTunes match so that means all my music, even stuff I didn't purchase from iTunes, is easily accessible to listen to through my main entertainment system.I like the AirPlay functionality with my iPhone.I use the Netflix and Youtube apps a lot, those are great. I use Pandora and Vimeo sometimes. I have experimented with the radio app which is interesting but haven't used it much.As other reviewers have noted, I would have liked to have the ability to add apps over time, and/or get things like Hulu Plus, which the Roku has. But, the smoothness of the presentation and easy integration with my existing iTunes stuff is pure Apple.UPDATE 9/5/12: As you probably know, the Apple TV has Hulu Plus now. That is a great addition! The only other thing that would be extra great would be Amazon Prime Video but I doubt that will happen due to direct competition between Apple and Amazon. I did hear that the iPad has some kind of Amazon Prime app, though, so you never know.I am continuing to use the Apple TV about 50% of the time that I have my main TV on now. I still have cable and will DVR network and cable shows that I want to watch as they are broadcast. I find the interface and remote for Apple TV more pleasing than that for my cable box. I use Netflix and Hulu Plus fairly often. I am using YouTube, with its channels and subscriptions a lot more than I ever thought I would.",

I own this apple tv , roku 3, chrome cast and amazon firetv, I'm a cord cutter, tired of paying the huge cable bills.  So this review will have a pros and cons that considers the four &#34;tv boxes&#34; versus each other.ApplePros: smooth operations as far as the software goes (best  i have used), works great with all apple productsCons: software is smooth because apple limits the developers by only allowing certain looks and interactions, doesn't work with some other branded products, very limited apps. limited processor versus some of the others.Roku 3Pros: great overall box, largest number of apps (channels), smooth operations.Cons: no real cons except the slower processor (doesn't have a huge effect now but may in the future)ChromecastPros: Cost (cheapest of the four), easy install, size (smallest), cost, cost, costCons: need a computer or ipad/iphone/tablet or some other type of controller to operate, wifi reception is a little weak, buffers more than the others, has limited number of apps, has a limited processor.Amazon FireTvPros: best processor, with newest firmware as of may 29 2014 is very smooth, rapid growing number of apps, the voice search is nice and has improved.Cons: not many, i love this guy and will probably buy another one.To conclude i hope apple will allow for a little variety in their apps and open the API to the public.  I also hope that apple releases a new apple tv with improvements (basically to match the other in hardware).People who are apple fans will love this product, people who have a lot of apple products will love it, people with no apple products will be ok with it, and people who prefer other operating systems (windows, android, linux, etc) will probably prefer the Roku 3 (or maybe chrome cast,or amazon FireTv).",

It doesn't offer the largest variety of channels (though there are rumors this will change in the near future).  But, if you have other Apple products (iPhone, iPad, laptop) you can use the Airplay feature to project whatever is one your device onto your TV through the AppleTV.This helps to cancel out the lack of channels.  The feature does not work in all instances.  There are certain apps that do not allow the use of Airplay (the March Madness app is one example).The Roku 3 has more channels and a faster processor, but it does not have an airplay feature.AppleTV also works best when connected via Ethernet as opposed to wi-fi.The appearance is small and discrete but requires sightline for the remote to work. Also, concerning the remote, if you have an Apple laptop the remote controls the volume on your laptop.  This may be an added bonus unless you are on your laptop and someone else is browsing through shows on the AppleTV.  Your volume will increase and decrease with the familiar *blip* each time.  This gets old quick.  I've given up on using my laptop and AppleTV in the same room unless I'm Airplay-ing something from my laptop.All-in-all it isn't bad.  Definitely worth it if you already use Apple products.  If you aren't an Apple user you're best suited to use a different product.",

For the Netflix app, there's a 150-title limitation on the Apple TV -- a serious issue if your digital cue is as large as mine!The best feature of the Apple TV is Airplay, which works more smoothly with Apple products than the Roku's similar mirroring feature.But, beyond Airplay, you're better off going with the Roku 3 (or, perhaps, the Amazon Fire TV, which was released after I purchased my Roku 3), even if, like me, your computers and phones are Apple products.",

    "reviewText": "I got Apple TV as a gift for Xmas this year.  It is a great little box.  Very sleek looking, uses little power, and integrates with all your iPhones and iPads.  The quality of the video is awesome.  Mine is streaming over 5ghz wifi without a hitch.  Perhaps those that complain about video quality do not have the proper router.  Regardless, mine streams perfectly.Here is why this works for me: I subscribe to DirecTV.  I have two set-top boxes (one in the family room and one in the living room).  Each of those TVs also has an Xbox 360 and a blue ray player attached.  The TV in my bedroom has no set-top box, no 360, and no DVD player.  It simply pulls in beautiful free HD over the air.  Enter Santa and my Apple TV.All in all I am happy with the unit.  The Netflix app is not as user friendly as the Xbox app, however, it gets the job done.  I like that I can pull content from iTunes and or my networked computer.  Air Play is really cool.  Where it is lacking is APPS!  I would like Flixster, Amazon Prime, and just more content.  I will use ESPN, MLB, NETFLIX, and the Disney apps when the kids come in and snuggle with my wife and I on the weekends.I like the unit and am glad Santa brought it.  However, it may not work for your specific needs.  The Roku may be more of what you are looking for.  They need to crank out more apps!UPDATE 1/6/2014:I bought a Roku 3 as well.  Both are great boxes but I think I actually prefer the Apple TV.  I ordered another unit and just canceled Direct TV.  I have the best of both the Roku and Apple TV.  Prefer the Apple TV for the integration with my iDevices and AirPlay.",

Biggest negative about ATV was the lack of apps ,well they just added hulu app yesterday and launch of amazon videos app on iPad makes me beleive that amazon video app will follow suit. As far as the graphics and streaming quality goes its top notch. I use my laptop as server and stream all my music (including FLAC files) using audiogalaxy app which works very well. Same for all the movies in different formats (.mkv, Divx etc) works great with online conversion. Those are two great things (besides obvious airplay etc) that i like about apple tv.

    "reviewText": "I got this for 2 reasons. 1st my Sony str-dn840 has airplay but uses an awful high contrast graphical display with no screen saver that burns and image into my plasma tv. The Apple TV's Airplay playing capability is better. It allows browsing from its gui of networked shared libraries, and it has a nice screen saver. 2nd, the Apple tv allows for Airplay mirroring and iCloud photo sharing. This allows you to easily watch videos taken on your iDevice on the big screen, or view your iDevice photos saved to iCloud. Yes, you can do this with any tv or blu-ray player with HDMI and a Apple AV cable. However, the proprietary cable costs $50 and the Apple TV costs $85. To me its a no-brainer to by the Apple TV for this use case for an additional $35.Of course all of this assumes you are already heavily invested in the Apple universe with iPhones, iPads, Macs and iTunes, and care about watching iPhone videos and photos on your TV. There is another issue as well. Apple is a content provider though iTunes. They really don't compete with Netflix, as they don't provide a subscription service, so you get that, but they do compete with Amazon for movie rentals, so you don't get an Amazon app. You still need another device to use your Prime streaming or rent movies from Amazon which are cheaper than iTunes. Roku on the other hand isn't an Amazon competitor, so you get Prime along with many more streaming services.Performance wise, the Apple TV has plenty of storage so that buffering and streaming quality don't seem to be an issue. Also the Apple TV has some other potential. They do add content, and there is word that Apple with update the software with more app store-like functionality, so that developers can make apps for it. We'll see. For now its a good unobtrusive player, with Apple universe integration and less content than Roku or XBMC. Well, that is, unless they develop an Apple TV 3 jailbreak.One more thing. Airplay mirroring ONLY natively works with newer Macs with better graphics hardware and iOS devices. To use AIrplay mirroring on older Macs you need to buy the AirParrot app. I can attest that this works well on a ram upgraded late 2008 MBP, but it does use a lot of system resources and spins up the fan quite a bit.",

I couldn't bring myself to spend $99 for an item that might not be any better than what I already have.Fortunately I received one as a birthday present, and I love it!  I use my personal Apple TV primarily for Netflix, and to play music.  I purchased a second Apple TV for my bedroom for the same reason.  Being a part of the Apple ecosystem, I find that the device works really well.  I found that iTunes runs far better on the Mac than its Windows counterpart.  When Vista came out, I made the switch to Mac, and haven't regretted it.PROS:I find the interface far more intuitive than the one on the TV, and easier to use.  Using my iPhone and iPad as a remote control adds further ease of use, as I can use the touch screen to type, rather than the Apple Remote.I like the ability to stream music from my computer to my TVs.  Being a Mac user, this is an easy link to set up.  I turn on my TV many mornings just to listen.Airplay Mirroring is a great feature.  On occasion I use my TV as an additional monitor for my laptop.  This is an important feature at my office.  We hooked one up in our conference room to enable an easy hook up to our TV display.  It makes connecting extremely painless, and wireless.CONS:The biggest downside that I have is that they don't have an Amazon interface.The iTunes movie store / rental system is a bit pricy.  If I wish to rent a movie, I will usually switch over to my SmartTV to save a few bucks.",

A couple years went by and I acquired a few more Apple devices and found myself wanting to stream music wireless, watch TV shows without cable and use my TV to show other media during get togethers at my home. I debated between all the competitors to the Apple TV and highly considered Google chrome cast because of it's low price tag, but when it came down to it, the Apple TV is the best device of its kind for connecting your iOS device to your home entertainment setup. The Airplay feature made my decision since the other streaming devices relied on apps and not the actual iPhone, iPad, etc. I can mirror anything on my device and not just a tab or stream from just a certain app. My whole device can stream audio and video to my TV which is exactly what I wanted.It is limited on the amount of apps it has and while I thought mirroring my Macbook or iPad would be the same it wasn't. The aspect ratio of the device is transferred to the TV. This isn't an issue with the Macbook, but who wants to relax and watch something using your computer to control it?! The iPad and iPhone create odd black space around the video which isn't ideal.Overall I'm very satisfied and although there's rumors of a new version coming out very soon I was excited to have this device and at the discounted price offered by Amazon.",

    "reviewText": "I had a reasonable idea of the limitations of the Apple TV from reading the reviews.  I decided to pick one up anyway just to replace my composite video cable adapter that was busted.  That cable costs around $40-$50 and I was able to get the Apple TV for $75.  So instead of hooking a cable from my iPad to the TV, I transfer the video/picture/audio to my TV via the Apple TV and the Airplay function.  When I bring up my video on the iPad, a rectangle with a triangle under it shows up.  If you click on that, my Apple TV shows up and I select it.  When I hit play, the video is transferred via the wireless router in my house to the Apple TV and from the Apple TV to my TV.  As a wireless extension to my iPad, Apple TV seems to work well.  That's worth a solid 3 stars.However, the Apple TV has pretensions of being a multimedia player.  At that, it fails miserably unless your primary source of video and music is from iTunes, Netflix, or Hulu+.  Quite a few folks have raved about the Apple TV menu.  The reason it is reasonably clean is due to the lack of options.  You cannot watch any of your own content unless you have purchased it from iTunes or have it reside on your computer iTunes account.  I knew about this limitation before purchasing this box but I was still shocked with the lack of functionality.  One nice feature is the ability to display your Photo Stream from your Apple iCloud account on your TV as a screen saver.  All in all, I give Apple TV perhaps 1/2 a star on the Photo Stream support but nothing else.So if you are looking to extend your iPad/iPhone/iPod to you TV without wires, this is a nice box (though you need to have a wireless network in your house for it to operate).  If you don't need that wireless extension, don't pick up this box unless you are a big iTunes user.",

Two iPhones, two iPads, and regular use of iTunes for media management. Plus, Comcast supports the HBO Go app on Apple TV, while they don't (as of this writing) support it on Roku. We use the Apple TV for Netflix, HBO Go, and iTunes media access.

I was honestly really impressed with the simplicity of the box/packaging design. And that was before I even plugged the unit in. Once I did that, I continued to be pleased with my decision. It just works. There is some authentication/signing in for the various apps, but once that's done, the device just works and works well. I do recommend making use of the Remote app for iOS during setup. Entering usernames and passwords is much nicer on the keyboard on the iOS device instead of the onscreen keyboard.I honestly don't have any complaints about this device. I even love the remote. It is sleek, simple, and easy to work with.",

I also own a Roku 3, but the Apple TV is a much more polished product and has noticeably better image display properties.

    "reviewText": "I have owned a 1st gen Roku box almost since they were released and I use it nearly every day.  As an Apple heavy household (MacBook Pro, iPad, iPhone, and two Apple AirPort Routers, etc) being able to mirror those devices onto he Apple TV was very appealing. It is wonderful and was easy to set up. For other Apple households I highly recommend it. It may be somewhat less interesting for PC homes, especially if without any iOS devices.But the following is why I'm writing this review:I just bought a refurbished Apple TV from Apple last weekend. I had a hiccup getting Photo Stream to work and called Apple Tech Support. Along with their world class tech support from the Canadian tech I spoke with (we solved the issue quite quickly), she told me something that is not well known. If you buy AppleCare for your Apple TV, the coverage extends to any AirPort Extreme or AirPort Express routers you may have, as long as they are less than two years old. (Of course all Apple products have 90 tech support from date of purchase.)AppleCare, for some reason, isn't available for the routers on their own, but being able to get it via Apple TV was wonderful news. For $29.99 (list price) you can ensure you get two years of tech support for any networking issues you may develop. Since a one time tech call for products out of tech coverage is also $29.99, why not cover all your bases at the start, and for as many issues that arise?My original AirPort Extreme router was over four years old, so I decided to upgrade to the newest dual band version a couple of days ago.  Although I did call tech support to walk me through the set up, it couldn't have been simpler with the AirPort Utility App that is included in Lion and Mountain Lion as well as on iOS 6 devices (iPhone and iPad, for example). Again I received world class service. Last night it turned out I needed to fine tune one setting, and the Canadian tech I spoke to also suggested investing in AppleCare for the Apple TV for the reasons I've just given, and I have done so.This \"wrap around\" coverage to the routers also come from Apple iMacs, MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and iOS devices. For some reason this isn't commonly known, but it should be.  Networking issues can crop up, and having someone troubleshoot them for you can be very expensive. They also drive me crazy with frustration and knowing I have Apple to lean on is a huge relief. Their support is incomparable and North American-based. Every time I've ever had to call (and not many that) I am more impressed by their level of training, their patience and good will. They are my tech angels!",

    "reviewText": "I have to start with this preface: if you are choosing between an Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, Amazon Fire, etc and you are already within the Apple Ecosystem, I'm 90% sure you will be most satisfied with the Apple TV.All of my electronic devices are on OS X or iOS. The Apple TV centralizes all of my devices. It connects and streams off my iTunes library and iTunes account. I use it for iTunes Radio as well, but can watch movies and listen to music straight from my computer (good thing because I'm tired of buying HDMI cables that stop working). Additionally, I love AirPlay. If I'm too lazy to go on the YouTube app or can't view something on the Apple TV (because there is not ATV app for it), then AirPlay will just throw it on the screen.That said, there are two things you should also consider that would actually make this thing useful: a good Wi-Fi connection and subscription to services like Netflix or HBO GO etc. The latter is not as important because I know a lot of people just use it to stream from their computer or use the free services that are included, but you can maximize how amazingly convenient this thing is through Netflix or HBO Go services and the like. But I can't stress the importance of Wi-Fi connection. If it's slow or unreliable, it will really diminish the enjoyment of this device.Another thing that I like? I can watch stuff on my own time and interest. I stopped watching TV years ago but I still see how people just mindlessly watch whatever is on, no choice and limited to time (even if they have DVR). Not only that, you don't have to pay $50 for like 4 channels you actually want and 600 others you don't care about. If you Netflix and other services can suffice your selection, you can either save money on entertainment subscriptions OR allocate some of those savings towards faster internet (and you'd probably still have some money left over for gas or food!).",

    "reviewText": "I have two of these, they work very well although slow to go through the menu and options. The toughest thing about the Apple TV is you are at Apples mercy when it comes to updates at which time they may add one or two new channels, so it really is limited. They do not have Amazon Prime, so I recently purchased the ROKU 3 for that purpose.I guess it's about how you use a streaming device, I don't care about AirPlay; I don't listen to my iTunes on the TV, I don't care about having photos up and I don't rent / buy movies from iTunes. But if you do or like all that this is a five star unit. I just want Prime and maximum streaming options and flexibility, ROKU does that. So don't get me wrong it's like serving a beautifully prepared filet mignon to a vegan! The Apple is best if you; 1. own Apple devices and  2. use them in conjunction with the TV.The other issue I have is the remote has to be very close to the unit and nearly in front to change channels, very annoying. There is an App that takes the place of the remote, and that is certainly useful.Frankly with ROKU at the same price the  Apple doesn't make sense, it  is too limited and not flexible, I should be able to buy Apps the way I do on any Apple product. I cannot recommend.UPDATE: to be fair in reviewing this I am trying out the music channels and they are wonderful! Very surprising fidelity, excellent. Set it up through my receiver and the music reproduction is awesome. Again I continue to feel there are not enough APP options and flexibility compared to the ROKU, but I am among the converted when it comes to what it does offer. I will add I have it connected directly to the router, not WiFi so that helps.I continue to feel it is largely geared to Apple products users, and frankly if it had Prime I wouldn't feel the need for the ROKU. Since I have both I would say if you have to buy only one and want Prime, ROKU is not a compromise. If you don't have Prime and don't care and want the best in Audio/ Video reproduction quality Apple is the way to go.",

    "reviewText": "I'm currently using the Apple TV as a replacement for cable or satellite TV.  I'm currently running the Apple TV through a Pioneer AV receiver and a Samsung 65\" LED TV.  I couldn't be happier with the Apple TV's picture quality.  The sound quality is also superior, but it is limited to a 5.1 output.Without cable, I'm using an off-air antenna to provide local channels and supplementing with Netflix and iTunes through the Apple TV.  I'm thinking about adding Hulu Plus as well.  I've used the built-in apps in my Samsung TV and a PS3 to stream Netflix before.  While I had good results using the PS3, I prefer to use the Apple TV.  The Apple TV also allows me to access iTunes, which is great for shows which are not on Netflix.  I'll gladly pay $40 for a season of a show that I want to watch vs paying $80+ every month to the cable company.When using iTunes, the picture is a full 1080p.  The streaming is very smooth and it takes almost no time to buffer.  My internet connection is through AT&T; U-Verse and is 18MBPS.I also subscribe to iTunes match, which allows me to play all of my music through the receiver which is hooked up to the Apple TV.  It also runs very smoothly and is fully controllable from my iPhone or iPad.  Additionally, I often stream Pandora from my iPhone via AirPlay through the Apple TV.  The Apple TV even displays the album cover art when listening to Pandora in this fashion.Overall, I'd say it's an excellent replacement for cable.  The setup was easy (HDMI cable hookup and the software walks you through getting it connected to your WiFi).Pros - Excellent quality picture and sound, full access to the Apple universe, streams/mirrors iPhone, iPod, and iPad, easy setup, great Netflix interface.Cons - Limited to 5.1 surround sound, can't download apps (as of yet).",

I had the first generation Apple TV and this is replacing it for all the new features (like Netflix streaming and Air Display). My OLD Apple TV still works and rents movies from iTunes but its much larger, runs very hot, wont stream netflix, and is overall just a bit clunkier than the new model. The NEW Apple TV is small, quick to start up, consistently pops open when you touch the remote button and swaps from room to room quite quickly. The AirPlay feature is quite nice and allows me to play my Spotify playlists through my tv/stereo and even pops the name of the songs on screen. My only grips about the product might be the streaming speed. The old Apple TV had a hard drive where the rented iTunes movie would download directly and play - this has a flash memory that temporarily stores the movie for playback... if you start an HD movie then stop it so you can finish up the movie later, you seem to have to wait for the buffer to start the download again (like it never fully downloaded the movie the first time. I only noticed this when downloading an HD movie off itunes (which are quite large anyway) and have not noticed such a lag when watching HD Netflix streaming movies. Other than that minor quirk (which may be addressed in a future upgrade - or may just be wifi speed related) I love this thing and actually am considering buying another for our other room so I dont have to keep moving it back and forth.",

I wanted to show videos and slide presentations loaded on the mini Ipad to a larger television screen. This gave me that capability but also is a great way to access photos and ITunes music playlists through my home network (As long ITunes is up and running on the Windows 7 PC in my home office).  Thirdly, it's a very good way to access streaming video applications such as Netflix or Hulu. The streaming capability seems to produce better sound and picture clarity than my Sony Blue Ray DVD players or PS3 with less buffering.  I hooked Apple TV through my Bose home theater system (which even had a setup expressly for Apple TV). Apple TV produces Dolby 5.1 surround sound through my Bose system quite nicely. It seems like a cost-effective way to add service to a television in that part of the house where you don't have cable or satellite television service connections.The main down side is that many of the applications do require that you have a service such as Direct TV or Xfinity somewhere in the house.  And you will need a home wireless internet network. Hulu Plus, HBO Go, and Pandora are now among many services offered by Apple TV, so there's a nice variety of applications available, some requiring subscriptions service (such as Netflix) or service from a tv provider (such as ABC, Disney, and HBO Go applications.) Regrettably, Apple TV does not offer an Amazon Prime Application.",

Then a few months later I got one of those Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital movie packs of &#34;Bedtime Stories&#34;. So I downloaded the digital copy to my iTunes account and was instantly wowed with the fact I could stream my digital movie collection to my apple TV, in essence, my very own Netfilix.This go me thinking about my second ATV, this one was going into my child's room because I was always finding DVD's laying around in the room that was previously watched but never put back, (Probably due to the fact I had a 400 DVD Changer).  This began my search, no my quest to figure out how to rip my movie collection to digital copies from the DVD so that my child could stream them to the TV in that room.  Eureka, I figured it out and I was off to building my very large digital movie collection and now not having anymore damaged dvd's I can save these in the cases to always come back to them if needed.Now, because my child had there own ATV, I figured...heck I should have my own for my room.  So, I got one for my room to enjoy the contents before bed.  I love these ATV, if I was watching a movie in one room and wanted to continue where I left off in another room, YUP it does that.  I love having the ATV remote app for my phone too, it makes it easier finding the remote with my phone then looking for that tiny silver remote that comes with it, so those are stored away as well for backups.I have since expanded my ATV to 2 other rooms in my house and I have a whole different network for my camper with its own ATV setup to use while on camping trips when its either too cold out or raining.If you are a Apple fan, you will love these small black boxes of joy.  I sure do!!!",

The controller and device are sturdy and feel like quality products like most of Apple's branded products.Pros: Usability and functionality are nice. It interfaces seamlessly with Apple products.Cons: Apple proprietary, so no go on other wireless devices, which for any Apple user should know this anyways. Limited amount of channel options such as Netflix, Hulu, etc. This is why I gave it 4 stars. The price is a little steep to have such a limited selection compared to Roku, but the quality of the product is better. Don't forget you have to buy a HDMI cable for this product!",

I'd used a wire before that, and besides all the hassle trying to hide it, it was picking up hum from the power lines. No such problems with the Apple TV, and as an added bonus we can also look at photos and watch movies from the iPhones and laptops, too. Even better, the Apple TV was actually less expensive than the Apple Express that would have relayed only music. I can't say much about using Netfilx and other streaming services as the data caps that come with our satellite Internet service don't really allow much traffic, but if there were any other Internet service available here I might consider dropping our satellite TV service.The only draw back is that it takes the Apple TV a little while to come on when power is first applied, but that would be a non-issue if it was powered with an always on outlet.",

For the most part, Apple TV does work fine and is easy to operate.  If you are connected to a cable network, the other uses for this product are unnecessary in my view.  The newly released movie rentals are more expensive than my cable network charge, the other uses are for apps like youtube and internet radio, which again you get with cable.  The one feature that I have used that is useful is Airplay.  That feature allows you to take content from your  home computer or other portable device and show it on your TV.If you want nice quality movies thru Netflix (based on your internet service) I would recommend this product.

    "reviewText": "I really enjoy this device.  I should note that my family has many other apple devices that work with Apple TV, and as many other reviews have stated your experience with apple TV is likely to be more enjoyable if you already have a macbook, iphone, ipad, etc&#8230;What do I use apple TV for?  Personally, I use Apple TV for watching TV, Movies, and for airplay (mirror what&#8217;s on my iphone or ipad right onto the tv).  However, the device offers far more options that I have not yet taken advantage of.How do I watch TV and Movies?  Well there are mainy ways to do so with Apple TV.  Here are the ways that I&#8217;ve tried and enjoyed:1) HBO GO channel:  If you subscribe to HBO already, this is a fantastic way to watch HBO content.  This is one of my favorite uses of Apple TV and probably worth the cost of the device in and of itself (for me).2) Netflix Instant:  Another great channel and you can set it up so there&#8217;s a designated area for kids or adults.  We have it set up so the kids have one channel with only acceptable content.  We use this a lot.3) Airplay: I sometimes use this to mirror what&#8217;s on my iphone or ipad right onto the tv.  Great for pictures or videos I may want to show family members.  That&#8217;s mainly how I use this feature, but you could do more with it (like watch movies or shows).4) Other Channels:  Youtube, Disney, and a few others I use on occasion.5) Itunes:  I rarely rent or purchase shows or movies from itunes, but easy to do from Apple TV.  Plus it&#8217;s easy to access old content you may have purchased.Other Information:Set-up:  I thought the set-up was easy. Opened up the package, connected device, and it turned on.  It took a few minutes to log-in and link to my wi-fi, but pretty straight forward.Remote:  Small and simple to use.Apple TV Device:  Very small and looks exactly like the picture.Cords:  Comes with HDMI connector.Picture:  I&#8217;ve had no issues.  Everything seems to work just fine for me, but I imagine this could be a factor if I had a very slow network at home (glad I don&#8217;t).  Something to keep in mind though.Automatic System Updates:  This is a plus since there are periodic updates (adding channels or features).  Like other apple devices this runs smooth.I&#8217;ll update this review as I try more features, but overall I haven&#8217;t noticed anything that&#8217;s made me regret purchasing this.  Based on my 5 star review I would recommend buying.",

On opening the box and setting it up (very easy to set up) this became my primary way of watching shows. I have an older tv that doesn't have netflix or other apps built in. However, t ended up getting rid of my cable because I am able to watch hulu and netflix, and use the Airplay to stream any other shows I have. I think considered getting a Roku as they are reputable as well. However, with me having an iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro, it's a no brainer of having the Apple TV to work seamlessly with all other Apple products. It excels extremely well at this. Being able to mirror whatever on my iPhone or iPad is one of the best features of the Apple TV. Definitely a great product, very satisfied customer!",

    "reviewText": "I used to love the Apple TV for one reason, early movie releases.  I could buy movies sometimes as much as two weeks earlier than the physical version and while I didn't buy many, I could rent others.With Apple TV you have a very simple device that pretty much plays movies, music, YouTube videos, Netflix, and TV shows.  Yes this is cool and the interface just works but, it is seriously lagging behind other devices in the market.  For instance, my Google TV has Hulu Plus, Netflix, Play Movies, Crackle, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Flixster, Vudu, Amazon MP3, Pandora, slacker, play music, and a whole host of other options as well as the ability to manage my whole entertainment experience.The first problem is obviously, flexibility and other devices with Google TV or Roku boxes have way better options available to them.  The second issue is that Loyalty isn't rewarded with Apple!  You see, Apple feels that their exclusive product is worth more for rentals over shorter periods of time than the competition.  Both Amazon and Google deliver their rentals at lower prices and Amazon actually gives you twice as long to watch the movie.So, I honestly have to say that you should pass up the Apple TV until Apple gets their head out of their sphincter!  Mine is sitting here where I cannot sell it because I have too many movies that I stream with it (About 30) but, I won't give them any more of my money until they start Rewarding Loyalty instead of Taxing It!",

I didn't think I would notice as much difference as I do, and the 1080P programming on iTunes is just gorgeous. I'm re-watching things like the scenes in Breaking Bad with those gorgeous New Mexico landscapes and the detail and picture quality is wonderful. I'm on an old Sony HDTV, which is 1080P, although only 60 hz, so I expect the picture quality may be even better on newer TVs. So, a big thumbs up for the 1080p picture and ITMS programming content.The other big plus with this device, is that if you are in the Apple ecosystem, everything just works. iPhones and Macs can copy their screen content to this gadget with a single click. Simply wonderful. Last summer I used my iPhone and the previous Apple TV to watch the Tour de France using the NBC iPhone app and streaming it to the Apple TV. For $15, I got commercial free, near-HD quality live from the Tour. It was the best TdF coverage I've ever watched and a bargain.Apple has added many services to ATV: PBS, Hulu, Smithsonian, etc, but you don't get all the choices of something like a Roku. However, between Netflix, iTunes, PBS, Smithsonian, Comedy Central I have more programming than I can watch, and it's quality stuff, not the BS of 300+ cable channels that I never look at.ATV let me cut the cable cord years ago, and I've never missed it.",

I did not have to wait about 15-20 minutes for the 2 GB file to download to my computer. It was available immediately for instant viewing through Apple TV!  Another great benefit of this device is that you can stream videos from Netflix and Hulu!  Picture and sound quality is outstanding(I have a 720p HD TV).I love the fact that I can also control my Apple TV through a \"Remote\" app on my iPad.  So, if I ever break or lose my Apple TV remote, I can still use my iPad! Apparently, you can also use your iPhone and iPod touch as well. There are a lot of other outstanding features of this product; I  encourage you to read other reviews and the product description.This product is yet another reason why Apple is so successful and why they're recognized as a tech giant.

It does not give you channels to watch at your leisure, but it will provide you with an easy to access and easy to navigate way to access plenty of online content such as itunes rentals, Netflix, video podcasts, Youtube, and Internet radio, plus a few others.But where this box really shines is when you pair it with another Apple device such as an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch.  When running on the same network you are able to use \"Airplay\" to mirror your device onto your TV quite seamlessly and without wires.  Want to play your tunes on the nice speakers while you clean?  Easy.  Share your vacation pictures on the big screen with no fuss?  Simple.  You can even play games with the big screen, however depending on your network speed there is about a half second delay.I can't count how many times the music in our house has been pumped through the Apple TV.  Our TV system has the best speakers so it makes sense.Want to entertain the kiddos?  Airplay your ipad/iphone and turn on the video camera and let the kids have fun seeing themselves on TV.  Trust me, this entertains kids for quite some time.For the price, its a no-brainer.  It's not going to give you local channels, or replace all of the content you get with Satellite or cable but its a nice complimentary device for Apple users to take advantage of and at the $100 price you won't regret it.",

    "reviewText": "I've purchased three Apple TVs over the past few years & have loved them all. I've given one to my parents & one to my sister none who are tech savvy, but they love how easy it is to use. To be fair I own a Ruko & Netgear Net-Neo as well and have found myself using the Apple over the other two. It's simple, no useless buttons and pretty much idiot proof for me :) The best feature in my opinion is the ability to add your own movies, tv shows and music to box. I've added home movies, purchased DVDs and lots of other stuff I can't add to the other streaming boxes. Plus I love using my iPhone, iPad or iPod to stream music, videos or whatever so easily. The pictures comes out clear, the sound crystal and no hiccups in the streaming. Also with the Apple TV you have the ability to block certain content if from nosy ankle bitters or Tweens. It's a fantastic way to gather the whole family for movie night without the hassle of driving to Redbox or a video store. Yes, the rentals are a bit higher, but you save time, milage and gas by simply staying at home.Now with the new update Apple offers more channels than ever. Channels I actually like & will watch. Disney, The Weather Channel, Sky News, HBO Go, Smithsonian, You Tube, and more. I cut the cable cord and honestly can't say I miss it. The monthly subscriptions to Netflix & Hulu Plus cost me less than twenty dollars a month. My dishnet work bill ran about 150 a month. Granted I can't watch new TV episodes until the next day, but really it's not a huge deal. If you're torn between streaming box sets it all comes down to this : Are you a Pro Apple person? If so get Apple TV. If not Ruko might be the best choice for you. Ruko allows you to stream movies from Amazon Prime, but you have to pay the 79 a year for the privilege. As for as streaming movies from your computer to the Ruko I haven't tried it so I don't know if it's possible.All in all I can honestly say Apple TV is my first choice when it comes to streaming TV.",

The Apple TV was given as a gift to my fiance and I and we absolutely love it. I have some experience using them at work, but I didn't know it's full functionality until I had one at home.From the Apple TV, we access our Netflix account and stream content to the TV and also watch movies that we have stored on the laptop. Through both Apple Mirroring and the home sharing, we're able to put the movies on my hard drive into iTunes, which is connected to the Apple TV. No more watching movies/tv shows on my 13&#34; MacBook Pro!You can also rent and buy movies and have them stored on the iTunes cloud directly from the Apple TV, which is another awesome feature.The best thing about the Apple TV was that it was really easy to set up. I literally plugged it in, connected the HDMI from my TV to the Apple TV, went to the appropriate input, and the directions came up on the screen and it was smooth sailing from there.I'd highly recommend the Apple TV to anyone, especially if you already own Apple products.",

Setup is easy but takes a while, because entering your passwords and usernames is painful on the included remote.

The only problem is that many of them, like HBO GO, require a cable subscription and HBO service. The PBS app works without a cable subscription, as does the Bloomberg and Sky News apps. There is not an Amazon Prime app, unfortunately.AirPlay, an Apple technology that lets you stream your screen contents from your OS X device or iOS device (iPad,iPhone), works flawlessly, I could see it being useful for presentations on TVs and it's a great way to share what you're doing on your computer with the family.

It brought Internet connectivity to my tv in a simple, elegant way. Is it perfect? No, but it does so much that you're willing to overlook its shortcomings.Plug in 2 cables, and you're done: power and HDMI. It's pretty simple to setup wifi, and then you're up and running. You have access to iTunes movie and tv show purchases through the cloud, you can access iTunes media from your computer, Netflix, Hulu plus, Vimeo, YouTube, and internet radio stations. There are other streaming video services available, but I haven't used those yet. Personally I'd like to see Amazon instant video and UFC made available, but those aren't available just yet. I'm keeping my finger crossed though.Another great thing about Apple TV is its smooth integration with other Apple devices. You can have it mirror your Mac computer screen, or stream music, videos, and photos from any iOS device. I love mine so much that I bought one for my brother and two for my mother.

Both coupled together are minimalist to the point where I could easily see them being very challenging for someone to use, whether or not they are age 50+.  Given the nature of the device mishaps with the remote are not without cost - rewinding your Netflix stream and watching it rebuffer to YouTube quality c. 2006 is not pleasant.  Perhaps if the UI was a bit more informative it'd make up for the remote's shortcomings, but no.I'll also add that the remote is so damn small it is very easily lost - between sofa cushions, underneath papers and magazines, etc etc.  I was ready to take a power drill to the stupid thing and attach a lanyard, but I bought a Fire TV instead.  It too is not without issue (where the hell is Cloud Player?) but it is far and away more user-friendly.Overall - a competent but not inspired piece of equipment.  It's great for NetFlix when you don't have a &#34;smart&#34; TV, and that's pretty much all I have ever used it for.  AirPlay streaming is nice; needing to constantly keep a computer on to use it is not.

Using Airplay couldn't be any easier with our phones (the family has 4...) and showing pictures from our Windows computer was also easier than before.  Compared to the Streaming BluRay (we had an LG and now have a Panasonic), the Apple TV starts much faster, has better and faster menu system, which delivers a more pleasant streaming experience.  Purchased shows from iTunes are about the same price as Cable VOD, but better quality.One trick worth mentioning--When we facetime my daughter, I mirror the image from my iPhone to the TV screen, place the phone on top of a speaker just under the screen, and two of us talk to my daughter on the big screen.  Works great, and its much more pleasant that trying to pass the phone back and forth or cram into the picture.We use it mostly for sharing pictures, and streaming Netflix.  Its been well worth the money just for the pictures.  We could share pictures on the TV before, but it required more hassle, and we only did it on special occasions.  Last week I took some quick shots and video of a warehouse on fire near my office, and showed them to my wife on the big screen before we watched a TV episode.If you are an apple family, its well worth the $100 to share photos on the TV with incredible ease.  But I would say its not a good purchase if you don't have apple products.  We can do most of the same things through a Streaming BluRay player--just takes more steps and time.",

It has great content, features, and I even did a Keynote presentation on it from my iPad using the AirPlay Mirroring feature. I cannot compare it to other competing devices, but it's hard to go wrong with this device. My only real complaint is that you cannot customize where the apps are on the screen...meaning I'd like to have the Netflix app closer to the settings app. Not a real problem, but would be nice.

    "reviewText": "So Apple TV is pretty awesome. It's fast, easy to navigate and is constantly adding new contents partners. So what is a downside of Apple TV? Honestly there is not much but a few things you should think about before buying one.If you are just wanting Netflix and could care less about viewing photos, mirroring displays, renting or buying movies and TV shows or playing music then Chromecast might be a better option for you. It's also less then half the price of an Apple TV.There are other options out there such as Roku. Roku is more open and has access to a bit more content, but that content is more obscure for most people and Apple TV has all the big players on board.  Where Apple TV is better then a Roku IMHO is interface and usability.  Roku is great but the interface can at times be slow and annoying. Apple TV has it's issues here and there as well, but using both for the last few years I get far fewer issues with my Apple TV, and Roku is very slow to update when issues arise.  So if you are the kind of person that has to have every single content provider under the sun a Roku is a damn fine device. If you are looking for all the best mainstream content with a lot of extras and a smooth interface then Apple TV may suit you better.",

    "reviewText": "Sorry for the comparative review,but Ii have a Roku 3,Roku 2xs, the Apple TV and Sony Internet TV with Google TV.  So I should be able to compare them. I purchased Apple TV, because I wanted to be able to use it io view my iPad, and the Roku does not have A Youtube channel. I find myself mainly using the Roku, but probably because I cant have Hulu on both devices.Even though I like checking the Roku app store, I rarely watch anything that Apple TV does not have. The Apple works smoothly, and was easy to set up. I have not had enough time with the Sony TV to comment, but I bought the Sony because it has Google chrome, and Google TV! which might be less expensive for renting, or buying titles. Since the Sony has so many options, and channels, and apps, if it works smoothly it might completely replace the functionality of the Roku, but not the Apple.  The one thing about Roku 3 is that you have the headphone jack on the remote. So I am finding that all three devices are great, I don't have cable TV so I have gone wild with these things. If you are an Apple person you should get one. If you don't have a Mac or iPad, it is great, but you might want to wait until the verdict is out on the Sony, or the Roku 3 for a less expensive, yet robust, mature experience, Or if you are saving a bundle, not paying for a landline and cable etc., then if the Sony turns out as good as the price, get both the Apple TV, and the Sony w Google TV.",

It allows you to:- Rent and purchase from Apple's vast digital library of movies and TV shows;- Play music from streaming radio stations (of which there are hundreds to choose) or your own music if you sign up for iTunes Match;- Browse your pictures from photo stream (quick tip: create a &#34;shared&#34; photo stream titled &#34;apple TV&#34; and add pictures from your phone or iPad that you want used as a screen saver, then set the Apple TV to use that stream for screen saver purposes);- Setup a home media library and have all of your movie collection at your fingertips (GREAT for kids, no more scratched or lost discs, and material can be censored with parental controls);- Use AirPlay to stream audio or video to your TV effortlessly (great for playing services like Spotify or watching video stored on an iPhone or iPad);- Use NetFlix, HBO Go, YouTube, Hulu, or any number of other supported services directly from the device with clean, easy-to-use interfaces and 1080p & surround sound support.There's no question that if you don't own any Apple devices the value of the product diminishes a bit. There are other devices that will play NetFlix, HBO Go, YouTube, etc., that will stream home library content (although most of those don't allow for parental controls if they're using DLNA as their backbone technology), etc. But if you have just one Apple mobile device - a phone or a tablet - the Apple TV is hands-down worth purchasing. It seamlessly integrates into your environment and allows you to enjoy the Apple ecosystem on your television, and AirPlay is such a convenience.",

This device made it possible for her to do quite a bit, and she is extremely pleased with it. She mostly used it do netflix, but there are many other useful apps. She often uses the remote ability to play her iTunes from her computer through it as well. The only issues she ever has from it are a result of her outdated and slow internet connection.The device itself is visually appealing. It is very small and has the signature minimalist Apple design. The remote included is also very impressive. It is simple with limited buttons, but does everything needed. It is made out of metal and feels like a quality product. For the sake of comparison, holding the remote feels a lot like holding one of the older generation iPod Nanos. I believe the one in mind is the third generation that was tall and skinny, and came in various metallic colors. The remote has a nice weight to it and the buttons seem durable.After a year of owning the Apple TV, my girlfriend still loves it. I would state however that other options may be just as good at a lower price. The Roku players are a very similar product that are cheaper than apples version, and I'm sure she would be just as happy with one of those.",

I have had many Roku devices and they've all worked fine, but I thought I'd try Apple TV for a change.  I have recently changed over to Apple Ipads and laptops so I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, from my first few hours with it I'm quite impressed!  The YouTube set up is awesome!  The picture is great, the menu works fine, and I couldn't be more impressed. And, YouTube has SO much great content!  You can find just about everything on YouTube, documentaries, full music albums, sermons, speeches, how to videos, movie clips, you name it and it's probably on YouTube!  And I have the Roku2 with all it's supposedly great channels.  But you know what I use it for?  Netflix, Amazon, and Vudu.  That's it!  Crackle sucks, it has commercials, and PBS is cool but it's on Apple TV as well.  The other thing I liked about Apple TV was the Airplay connection where you can stream from your MacBook, Imac, Ipad, or cell phone to your TV.  I tried it with a MacBook and it couldn't be more simple!  I streamed some Coursera courses on it from my Macbook, and it worked flawlessly!  The Neflix interface is a little snazzier on the Apple TV, a little more slick and prettier than the Roku.  The one thing I don't really like that much is the Apple TV Remote.  It's kind of hard to get used to, I was always pushing the middle button accidently when scrolling.  It's also very small and about 1/8&#34; thick and I wonder when I'm going to sit on it and break it.Other than that, like I said, I'm VERY impressed!  I'm glad I got the Apple TV instead of the Roku 3 which people seem to be having problems with.  But, I also kept my Roku2 and use it along side the Apple TV.  You just have to make sure you have a few HDMI slots on the back of your TV, which most TV's do have nowadays.  The Apple TV also is a nice piece of technology.  It is a lot heavier than the Roku, and doesn't seem &#34;plasticky&#34; like the Roku, but more like a solid hockey puck.  It's as easy to set up as it is to get a laptop hooked into your network, doesn't take 5 minutes.  All in all I'm impressed with the feel of the device, the interface is typical Apple cool, and everything works exactly as you would want it to.  What more can you ask for?",

A native APP to watch AMAZON PRIME videos.Currently (Dec 2013), it is possible to watch AMAZON PRIME videos by streaming them from an iPhone, iPad, iPod to the Apple TV via AirPlay, and while that's an improvement over the original feature-set, it is not as convenient as a native APP just like NETFLIX or HBOGO.2. Improved and expanded Apple's \"Remote\" APP functionalityThis app allows the user to control the Apple TV from an iPhone or iPad or iPod similarly as the remote control that comes included with it... In other words, you need to turn your TV on, and select the desired icon from those displayed on your TV screen. To some degree, that is OK if you want to watch a movie. What if you want to listen to iRADIO? It should be possible to select that icon right on the iOS device screen without having to turn on the TV. So, what I am proposing here, is for the Remote APP to show the same menu options on the iOS device screen as on the TV.3. Capability to turn on an A/V receiver automatically when streaming music via AirPlay to the AppleTV, and have the receiver select its input automatically to whichever HDMI port the AppleTV is connected to, and start playing the music \"with just one click\". This is what takes place if you start streaming music from an iPhone or other Apple device to receivers with built-in AirPlay capability such as Denon or Pioneer, and it would be particularly helpful with ONKYO's receivers which don't have built-in AirPlay capability at this time.",

    "reviewText": "This is my 2nd Apple TV device, and if they come out with a newer version, I will probably buy it too.  I am heavily invested in &#34;iDevices&#34; in my household - iPhones, iPads, and iTouch music players.  I have my iTunes library that controls all the devices tied to my main PC that is in the office of my house.  I use iTunes as my digital entertainment hub for all of my devices.  iTunes has all of our music, music videos, and digital movies (including digital copies that come with my blu-ray movies that I buy).  I was looking for a way to take all of that digital media and play it in the family room where the home theater is set up.  I chose the Apple TV device.This box is about 3&#34; x 3&#34; x1&#34; and is barely noticable.  Hookup is very simple - power cable, and HDMI cable to the receiver (or directly to TV).  Setting it up takes all of 10 minutes.  It can be connected to your network using a wired connection or wireless.  I use wireless in my house, so I had to set up the wireless on the Apple TV.  Once the Apple TV is connected to the internet, you will put your Apple ID and password in.  Everything you have purchased from Apple is now right there at your fingertips.  I also wanted to tie this device to my media collection that is stored on my PC in the office.  This requires you to turn on Apple's Home Sharing option.  Once you turn that on, the Apple TV will find your media library in iTunes, and make it available.There a few pre-seeded apps on the device (Netflix, HBO 2 Go, You Tube, etc.), plus access to all of the content you have in the Apple ecosystem.  Everything is simple to operate, the user interface is easy to understand, and if you have an HD TV, the quality of video is excellent.Again, I would recommend this to anyone that has a lot invested in Apple content and products.  Since this is a direct competitor to the Roku, Boxee, etc., the form factor of this is very similar to the others.  The only difference between these boxes is user interface and media options - for instance, a Roku box will not play anything you have controlled through Apple's iTunes, and vice versa.  Bottom line, this is made for people invested in Apple for their digital music, digital TV, and digital movies.  If you get your music from Amazon, use Prime Instant Movies, or buy music from Google play, this box will not work for you.  You will need to look at the Roku or other similar device.",

    "reviewText": "This is the 2nd Apple TV device I have purchased.  The first one I purchased to use at home to stream audio from iPhone to my home stereo along with streaming video/pictures from my iPad to my TV.  It worked so well that I bought another one for the office to connect to our 80&#34; TV that we use in our conference room.  We have a lot of internal people with iPads and iPhones that want to show live content from their idevices that it seemed like a no brainer to hook this up.  We also get quite a few external people that show up to our office for meetings with idevices and want to show content on our screen, so again the Apple TV works great for allowing this to happen.A couple of things to note on this application of Apple TV.One, using AirPlay (the mechanism to connect to Apple TV from a iPad/iPhone) to &#34;mirror&#34; your screen to a display/tv will only happen in a 4:3 &#34;like&#34; format for the iPad and an even narrower format for iPhones.  So, if you have a wide screen display (i.e. 16:9 or 16:10) then you iPad screen mirror will only take up the center of the screen with black bars on each side.  The image will rotate along with the respective screen orientation of the iPad, so viewing the iPad in landscape mode will fill more of the screen but not all of the screen.  Not a big deal, just a comment.Two, some iPad/iPhone applications can stream directly to Apple TV in full screen mode without having to use AirPlay &#34;screen mirroring&#34;, so you can fill your entire 16:9 wide screen.  For example the YouTube application can do this and fill the entire TV screen.And lastly, some ipad/iphone applications can deny your ability to use AirPlay to stream to your Apple TV.  For example, I was hoping my Xfinity application would allow me to stream movies to my TV but it told me I was not allowed to use AirPlay. :-(Just things to consider if you want to use the Apple TV for video streaming.  Streaming audio to your stereo system works great!  You need an optical digital input on your stereo to do this, so keep that in mind.  You can even stream music from your computer in iTunes over your network.  The Apply TV can connect to your network over Ethernet or WiFi.",

Both are exactly the same model (3rd gen, I think, which is the latest so far) and were purchased from Amazon within a year period.Both, when I considered purchasing the first one, and then the second one, I had in mind the following:1) I wanted a Hi-Def A/V IP tv box (no more standard-def through the Wii console Netflix), and work with HDMI cables (less cable clutter)2) It would have to be able to handle Netflix, YouTube, and then some3) Aesthetics were also relevant, so it would have to look sleek (if it was only really possible!), and have a small footprint and overall dimensions4) Finally, the deal-breaker would be if I couldn't find enough available content for it to show, since I spend many months every year outside the USA, and some video and music services (ie Rhapsody, Amazon Prime and many others) do not work outside the USA, but iTunes Store does.At the end it all came down to two serious contenders: the newest AppleTV, and the latest ROKU box.Having the iTunes Store content available overseas, on top of Netflix, was what tipped the balance in favor of the ATV, for the first time, and having had such a good experience with the ATV that time, set my mind into favoring the ATV unit for the second time as well. AirPlay from my kids ipods, and ipad, also proved to be a very nice feature. Hopefully with the coming OS upgrade, ATV might have some Apps capabilities coming into it soon.My internet connection is supposed to be 10 Mbps, and it measures up to 8-10 Mbps most of the time, and with that speed, I get good video and sound quality, without noticeable stuttering or long buffering times, so I'm satisfied with it.Amazon delivered on time, with super-saving free shipping, and the purchase price itself both times was marginally lower than Apple's official list price, so it proved to be a good deal for me. Hope you enjoy yours as well.",

Now I can use the TV screen to change music instead of the little iPod screen. Plus the Apple TV will apparently work with any brand of receiver. I had been streaming Netflix with Roku HD, but the Apple TV gives me more access to my account, so the Roku has been relegated to the less-used bedroom TV. I have my iTunes music on an external drive connected to my router, and I can listen to it without turning on my PC.The Apple TV and my Yamaha receiver's remote cannot be programmed to operate each other. So I have yet another remote. And Apple TV does not stream Pandora, but my receiver does.",

I believe all three of these say they can do on-the-fly encoding, which is what I was really looking for (I have a lot of HD movies in MKV format).  None worked very well, although Plex seemed to be the closest to what I was looking for.  But it just wasn't able to handle the HD MKVs and it was driving me crazy, so I just grabbed an AppleTV and spent a weekend converting all of my movies in handbrake.  Handbrake is free and easy to use and once you get the movies into a format that you can add to iTunes streaming to the AppleTV works flawlessly.  I thought having all of my movies and TV shows in iTunes would be a pain but it's actually pretty convenient letting iTunes do all the organizing.  However if you're using Windows and don't have a great PC then iTunes may very well be a deal-breaker.  My PC is pretty beefy so I don't have much of a problem.The interface is sleek and intuitive, as you would expect from Apple, streaming works great, connects via HDMI (although it also has an optical audio port which is nice).",

Displaying other picture albums is also fun to do.  A little disappointing when we try to project some apps from the iPad to the Apple TV and we get an error message that it is not supported.  I appears to be a licensing thing.  Apple TV is also nice for YouTube even though at times it &#34;stalls&#34; (YouTube waiting to download more content) when playing a selection and I am not sure if that is a problem with Apple TV or not but I don't think we saw as many stalls with our iPad 2 running on the same home network.  The one thing I should note is the YouTube app does not allow you to comment on YouTube videos after watching them like you can elsewhere.  I would suspect this was because with the tiny remote it would take forever to enter in a few sentences.  However, users can pair an Apple keyboard and that would work well for this.  Video through the many Apple TV apps are smooth even with my &#34;slow&#34; 3M DSL internet.  The unit is nice and compact and is extremely easy to set up when you first purchase it.  It is amazing how much you can do with a simple controlling remote but I would have preferred one with a few more buttons.  I would have given a 5 star rating if I didn't experience the YouTube stalls.  If this is a configuration issue, someone please note this and I will modify my rating.",

    "reviewText": "We got in our Apple TV and set it up instantly! The apple TV allows for access to Netflix and Hulu from the device through an app on there. I also found it was cheaper to just buy some of the seasons I love on iTunes than to have a bigger Dish package just to have that one channel so it has allowed us to save something like 200 dollars a year by looking at what we could buy or rent through iTunes and the channels and shows we currently watch. Hulu has access to tons of shows including the CW. We did have a slight hickup in doing the airplay from my MacBook Pro 2012 with the updated software. The CW website was having serious lag problems when it came to the TV screen. YouTube was also a little lagging from the computer to the TV screen through AirPlay. That is before I found the part where there's a YouTube app on the apple TV so you can simply search and show stuff through the device itself. I highly recommend looking at YouTube for people showing the device before you buy just so you know what it can do.In order to do AirPlay we did have to upgrade out software on our Macbook Pro 2012 but our &#34;New&#34; iPad's are already compatable and do the AirPlay brilliantly. One other addition when the iPad was hooked up the &#34;shown screen&#34; or the picture we were getting on the TV screen was smaller than the computer and when we just used the product itself. We have a wide screen TV. So it shrunk our TV quite a bit. You do have to pay for Netflix and Hulu if you want to use the services. Also I'll add in how the iTunes works. All your purchases are on there and accessible, but if you buy a season pass the show will show up one day later to be able to view. For example, my guilty pleasure Beverly Hill Housewives show's on the television on Monday's but I can't watch the show through iTunes until Tuesday. I think it's Tuesday at like midnight or early in the morning but it's always the next day even for American Horror Story. Hope this helps those that are curious about the apple TV.",

    "reviewText": "We previously owned the prior iteration of Apple TV circa 2011.  It was slick but had a very limited range and was effectively useless in our wireless setup. We switched to a dual band ROKU 2 XS and had improved results.  The ROKU was not that reliable, however.  It frequently dropped signal and most of the time played back in a format well below HD.  The device does not tell you the bandwidth directly but provides a range of one to four dots with all four being HD.  We almost never never got four dots. Most of the time we got three dots, sometimes 2 or even 1.  Still, it worked.We bought the new Apple not expecting any improvement in signal or resolution but merely to watch shows on HBO GO.  It turns out that the suits at ROKU, DirecTV (our service provider), and HBO could not agree terms to stream HBO GO.  So, we were able to watch HBO GO on ipods and pads and computers but we could not watch it over the ROKU on our TV (figuring this out by the way took forever; its a fact that all of the parties involved seem to want to keep well hidden).  Needless to say this was frustrating since we were paying for the service through the HBO subscription.Anyway, the new Apple TV was an unexpected delight in every way. The signal streams in HD almost all of the time.  It is fast, way faster than the ROKU, and you can rewind and pause without dropping the stream - a common event with the ROKU.  It is simply a much more powerful device than the ROKU. Build quality is typical Apple but at the high end of what they do.  It is a solid, heavy and robust feeling piece of gear.  Compared to the Apple the ROKU feels light and cheap. The milled aluminium remote is a delight to use and is far nicer than ROKU's remote which is really quite nice itself.  Presentation is sleek and navigation and setup are a breeze.  The exception is accessing a computer library through the network.  It doesn't bother me because I have a dedicated stereo and have no desire to listen to music through the relatively poor Sonos speakers attached to the TV.  Others may disagree.All of this was totally unexpected.  I had anticipated range problems and was hoping that APple had stepped up and fixed the issue.  They had.  I am not an Apple fan generally but on this piece of kit I think they knocked it out of the park.  On a functional, aesthetic, and build quality basis I would expect this to be $300 - $400 piece of gear.  Either ROKU is reaping huge profits or Apple is taking a hit to position itself for the full blown Apple TV ecosystem rumored to be in the pipeline.  I think the latter.  For $99 this is an incredible deal.  To say that an Apple product is underpriced is even more incredible but, however strange, its true here.I have to give this five stars on all counts with the obvious caveat that it would be nice to access one's Amazon library from Apple.  A really great little piece of kit and a nice surprise.  Well done Apple.",

But when I eventually did get around to hooking it up to see what my choices were I was very pleasantly surprised and it quickly became my most used product for watching shows on.It is different than the Roku because it does offer access to the Apple Itunes store, so I can purchase movies and watch them immediately right from my TV. But on the other end it's very similar to the Roku box because I still get to access my Netflix and Hulu accounts as well.Perhaps my favorite thing about the apple tv is that I can connect to any of my computer itunes databases through the homesharing feature. So any items that I previously purchased through Itunes can be played directly to my tv no matter where they are stored...and I have purchased and downloaded (from places other than itunes) many, many items.I rarely find a moment when I cannot find something to watch. It has a very clear picture and I have never had any problems with it stopping on me mid-way through my searching or watching of movies (I have had this happen to me with my cable box, and my roku box)",

When I got home, I realized she had either lied to me or simply hadn't got a clue.  The Computer part of Apple TV only streams from iTunes software on Mac or PC.However, with the help of a free app called MoliPlayer HD -- I first used this app last year on my Nokia Windows Phone -- and the wonderful AirPlay, it's a cinch to network-play my files on my NAS, a Diskstation product.  MoliPlayer HD can access any server or computer on your LAN (local area network), and play pretty all the video and audio formats out there.  The free version doesn't allow you to password-protect the app, but otherwise has all the major functions.  I just launch MoliPlayer HD, go to Nearby on the left, and it accesses my DiskStation as well as my Windows workgroup immediately. I then turn on AirPlay to send the media content to my Apple TV.The Apple TV is truly simple and elegant, and it just works.  I went through several Android-based media players but they were all difficult to use, froze frequently, not to mention anything from Google is reported to spy on you and your family.  On the Apple TV I can rearrange the app icons just like on iPhone or iPad. I can easily get rid off unwanted icons through the Restrictions settings. For instance, I don't have cable at home, so I remove things like HBO and ESPN and Disney channels.  Everything just works so well and so smoothly, even the screensaver is so well done.  AirPlay is indeed awesome!!  I plan to get an AirPort Extreme and AirPlay-ify all my media hardware.",

Anyways, this box might be good, if I had more money than brains and wanted to waste it on itunes videos, which are only useful in the apple ecosystem. Not sure what idiots pays these prices for something they can't lend, trade, give away, or sell. I guess the same is true of ALL drmed video. At least with discs, I'm capable of doing what i want with them. Another thing I hated was the sparseness of channels. I'd expect more big players like Amazon Instant Video to be available, but nope. The plusses I can think of are that it works well with my iphone, the airplay thing seemed cool, until you realize how many apps (like Amazon Instant Video) are crippled to not work.

Has gotten better, I just have to close of of Itunes each morning and relauch it for my library to come back up on the AppleTV.  Not the fastest streaming compared to something like Netflix but I am assuming it is due to the higher quality picture ATV puts out.  So those with slower internet connections (probably 6 and below) will not like the buffer time.  Airplay is great but keep in mind not everything is airplay supported, for example HBO2GO.  Getting HBO on board and a bigger selection of apps, LIKE AMAZON INSTANT, would make this worth every penny.  Hulu Plus was recently added which will help alot of people cut cable or dish.  Not quite a cable cutter for me since I have a handful of TV shows not on Hulu that I watch and paying $3 a episode in the Itunes store is not going to happen.EDIT 11/24..DROPPED THE RATING FROM A 4 STAR TO A 1 STAR.

    "reviewText": "A few years back when the second generation Apple TV came out I got it for my birthday and have used it just about daily in my living room. Being that I've used it so much, I recently decided it would be best to get another for my bedroom.I can't say that the Apple TV third generation is any better than the second generation, but it does seem a faster when navigating menus and loading content. Both of the televisions I have are 720, so I can't really comment on the picture quality, but I'm sure it would be better if I had a 1080.Setup for the Apple TV was a breeze. I had it connected to my iTunes account, Music Match, and streaming content in five minutes. However, it did have to upgrade to the newest OS which took some extra time.In my opinion the Apple TV is one of the most overlooked Apple products that will deliver you the most content to your television. With this device you can rent movies, watch Netflix, steam content from you iTunes library, and stream content from your other Apple devices. One of the other features I like, is the ability to stream music to multiple Apple TVs. You can make iTunes send your music to multiple rooms, which allows you to hear your tunes everywhere you go.Pros:- For under a hundred bucks there is nothing else on the market that can beat it- Steaming content from your computer is flawless- Free content to Apple events, like concerts and new products- Creates a seamless multimedia experience throughout your homeCons:- Wish airplay was a more open concept, which allowed other devices to utilize itOverall, if you are looking for something to make your TV a little smarter or a way to stream your home movies and other iTunes content to the big screen, look no further.",

Amazing.We have several apple products and this just makes them all better.

(i'm 1 year Halo sober!) But the bad part was no more hulu and netflix on our flat screen. My wife loved those features of xbox live. No problem now! We can watch our Hulu+ and Netflix shows on the Apple TV. And even better, NO SUBSCRIPTION. Just one time $99. No $50 yearly subscription needed.As you can see I love my Apple TV.

I think that it is pure and evil greed, no matter how high and holy Apple thinks it is.  Anyway, at least with iTunes one can share libraries.  With Apple TV, an user must sign out of his library and sign into another in order to watch shows or listen to music on that other library, even if the library is in the same house.  So, for example, I have to sign out of my Apple account and log into my daughter's Apple account, which means she needs to provide me her password, in order to watch a show that she has bought on iTunes, even though she still lives in my house and is sitting next to me while we watch the show.  That is infuriating!  Also, in Steve Jobs quest to simplify everything, he made it much more difficult to navigate the menu than it should be.  The controller should have more buttons on it, and one should not have to repeat actions so much.  I like the overall ability to play media through the Apple TV, but the interface needs to be expanded, and the restrictions need to be lifted.",

If you want something that's a portal to other content providers, you might want to consider something else.Make no mistake about it, Apple wants you to buy everything from them and nothing from anyone else. Nowhere is this strategy more evident than with the AppleTV. Other than Netflix and a couple of other services that, if not available, would render this product completely irrelevant, Apple makes sure you don't have access to competitors, like Flixster or Amazon. If you want a movie or television show and it's not on Netflix (and it probably won't be), you will have to purchase it, and the only place to get it is, you guessed it, iTunes. If you've purchased a digital copy of a movie on a cloud like Flixster, you won't be able to use the Apple TV to play it like you would on a PS3, XBox, Google TV, Samsung Smart TV or any of a number of open systems.Unless.That is, unless you have OSX Mountain Lion. If you do, you with one click, AirPlay everything on your computer on your television. Everything that's on your computer is on your television, including the sound. It's a great feature for making presentations or simply watching a movie.And it helps you subvert the brilliantly engineered iTunes Monopoly that comes installed with every product Apple sells.",

    "reviewText": "I'm basing my review off of the 3 big streaming solutions I currently own: The Apple TV, the Roku, and the Xbox 360. They're all good products, and they each have a slightly different purpose for existing. Below I review the Apple TV, and then compare it to the other solutions.What does the Apple TV have going for it?- The Apple TV syncs beautifully with all of your other iOS devices (iPhone, iPad), and now it also works wonderfully with Mountain Lion for Mac. Quite honestly, this is what makes this product so special. The ability to connect my iPhone up via AirPlay and listen to Spotify and Pandora in addition to my iTunes library is fantastic. With AirPlay Mirroring you can even watch apps like CNN live on the Apple TV (via the iPhone / iPad app). It seems almost like a bonus that it streams Netflix, and now Hulu Plus.- The biggest drawback this thing has going for it is apps. While you can now do much of these via the AirPlay mirroring, it would certainly be nice to have a dedicated ATV app. Especially for those without iPhones / Macs.- The pricing isn't bad in the iTunes Store. TV Shows run at $1.99 / episode ($2.99 HD), and movies you can rent for $3.99 ($4.99 HD). This is the same exact price you'll see in Amazon Instant.How it compares.To Xbox: Xbox 360 really has an ideal package going for it. It has a large library of apps (and continues to expand) and can play all the latest games. The apps range from Amazon Instant (a good equivalent to iTunes, though I notice more lag with Amazon), Netflix (the standard on everything), Hulu Plus, Hbo Go, and more. With the exception of Netflix and Hulu, everything else is missing in the Apple TV. I decided to start watching Netflix on ATV because the Xbox seems to lag with video streaming apps, but for everything else it works fine. Biggest drawback is price... While you can get a decent Xbox for $200 these days, you also pay annually for Xbox Live Gold to keep these apps. That'll run you an extra $60. You really don't find your value in Xbox Live unless you're also a gamer as well.To Roku: I like the Roku. It has a lot of the same apps as Xbox (with a few extra goodies like Pandora). You can use a lot of stuff without needing an iPhone or apple device. And it's a bit cheaper than the ATV or Xbox. This gadget seems to lack in video quality (noticed a big difference in color streaming with the Xbox and ATV), and occasionally the audio would cut out out on certain settings, but it does the job if you want a simple streaming device. They allow for people to make apps and add it to their market but, alas, it seems the marketplace has become stale. In the last 6 months I can't think of any apps that I downloaded and actually ended up using.In the end...Get the Apple TV if: You are looking to stream content flawlessly from iTunes, Netflix, or Hulu. And if you ALREADY OWN iOS devices / Mac computers.Get the Xbox 360 if: You like a lot of apps AND are into gaming. Otherwise you can go with option 3... The Roku.Get the Roku if: You're looking for a simple streaming solution that's easy to set up. It doesn't have any extra bells or whistles, but I'm guessing many people out there won't be looking for that. They'll just want to stream their content!Happy to answer questions below!",

It's twitchy with the pretty but annoyingly imprecise remote control and it's prone to typing phantom characters (which with a password which hides what you typed is maddening). Surely there is a better solution (bluetooth keyboard?). Also the selection of movies and TV shows and the prices won't cause me to rent many. I like the movie trailers but they need a lot more selection. If I'm going to pay through the nose here at least let me find what I'm looking for. Of the newish movies I searched for, none were there. I know that is just me, but it demonstrates how far they have to go. I get better hits in Netflix and their selection is pretty poor as well.Upsides: Youtube! And movie trailers. And EASY setup. And great industrial design (except for the remote). Streaming from my IOS devices (and eventually my computers).Please Apple -- fix the remote or at least give us an option to display what we're typing with passwords.

    "reviewText": "i used this to replace my antiquated stereo/dvd receiver station (only running internet based music/video options). The initial set up was quite consternating as the system would not recognize home sharing with my PC (and for that matter iPad and iPhone) based control system.  FINALLY, after several attempts with helpful AppleTV techs on the phone, figured out the problem was that AppleTV MUST be on the same network as the other &#34;shared&#34; devices. You cannot be on your &#34;guest&#34; network and also your administrative network. It also seems that you can't use your &#34;guest&#34; network even if all devices are on it!!Anyways, the system seems to work fine with the exception that the write-ups could easily lead a user to believe that the AppleTV will also send signals to AirPlay enabled speakers. This is NOT true! This means that if you have a totally wireless speaker system set up, any video type applications (Netflix for example) will NOT play on those speakers...only your TV speakers.Aside from those small points the system seems to work as advertised and provides an easy to use interface with a decent array of entertainment options.  Great way to simplify (and reduce clutter) an entertainment system.",

The greatest thing about this little (and I do mean little) device, is that it offers prime apps. Things like Hulu plus, Netflix, HBO go, and now recent additions such as the History channel and PBS it is just amazing. If you are like me and are tired of paying more than you have to to the cable providers this will help. We no longer use our cable box and strictly use the Apple TV for all of our streaming purposes. Another great perk is the easy transition of viewing content from our iPad, iPhone, and Macbook straight to the larger and bigger screen all because of the Apple TV. Virtually all purchases are synced through the account so it keeps adding to its value. It's a great buy and present to the tech person in your life. I have bought over four of them just as presents for others.Updates are constantly performed and I can only imagine other additions to the app/network line. It's the way to view television...

That $5 you spent on a movie, you can't watch it unless you stay in your living room. Or you can go back and forth trying to log out of Apple ID's trying to get it to play.

    "reviewText": "OVERVIEWIt's small, quiet, and fairly inexpensive, although competing products are quite similar in this regard. It's got a nice screen saver that uses your iPhoto or Flickr library, and is a nice companion to iTunes. Unfortunately, 1080p video playback is a little choppy, audio format support is extremely limited, and if your media isn't already in iTunes, you're in for some work if you want compatibility.AUDIODolby Digital, the audio format from the 1990's that is being phased out for DTS, TrueHD, or even DTS-HD is the ONLY surround audio option available on Apple TV. This is a major let-down, especially considering the jailbroken Apple TV 2 is capable of DTS pass-thru, and that DTS is an audio format made popular by DVD over a decade ago.VIDEOIt's true ATV3 does 1080p video, although it tends to stutter with complex motion when outputting the full 1080p (any scene with a full-screen pan will inevitably skip frames at 1080p), and will outright crash if the video reaches a bit-rate it can't handle. I encoded a few BBC Earth Blu-rays at 'constant quality' and any scene with lots of birds would freeze the ATV3 every time without fail, and the only solution was to re-encode the video at a much lower quality. It took a few encodes to find a setting that wouldn't freeze the ATV. DVD rips look great, and when playing to a 720p TV the video is crisp and smooth, especially when playing a 1080p source downscaled. Netflix HD streams also studded during complex pans.INTERFACEWhere Apple TV shines is the interface, it's pretty, easy and smooth; though that too has some issues, not the least of which is the common interaction of holding down the 'select' button - it doesn't always work or register, and when it fails, a restart is not enough, you must power-cycle the unit to fix it. It has a decent Netflix app, second only to the Xbox or iPhone version (I have Netflix apps on many devices), in that it displays the movie list nicely and does a pretty good job remembering where you were in the menus most of the time. It sports iTunes Cloud support, so if you're like me and you have your songs in the cloud, you'll save some room on your media center with it. Unfortunately, there's no way to watch Amazon Instant Video or anything else that doesn't have an iOS app, and even if it does, you have to occupy your phone or iPad with it to stream it to the ATV.HOME STREAMINGAnd then the 'Media Center' aspects. This is most important to me and probably other people, and it's where Apple TV is the among the worst. Sure, if you rip your videos right, they'll work great. I've got multiple audio tracks and subtitles and meta information in my videos and everything is great, but only after I've encoded them to the exact specifications required by Apple TV: x264 video, AAC stereo audio, AC-3 surround audio, and 3GPP subtitle text. Nothing else will work. I repeat, NOTHING ELSE WORKS. I've been ripping my collection since April (over four months) and I'm nearly finished, but there's many people out there who would (or did) scoff and call me a nut for not simply getting something that could play MKV files with modern audio formats and save myself hundreds of hours of CPU cycles.The exception, of course, is iTunes-purchased content, it's up to you how you value that.BOTTOM LINE (from a long-time Apple user)Unless you're an avid Mac user who's willing to rip his/her videos to work with iTunes in order to stream them to the TV, I strongly advise something with more modern specifications that can play MKV, DTS, and other formats that you most assuredly have if you're not already managing your media in iTunes.",

I had a Roku XD and I thought that the experience that Roku's unit provided was as good as it was going to get... Well, I was wrong!Roku's unit proved to be a horribly inconsistent performer when it came to HD content. Constant rebuffering and degradation of the (supposedly) high-definition content would have had me pulling my hair out, if I had any. For all of it's significant pros (a USB port, numerous channels, more functionality than the Apple TV) my little Roku box couldn't really deliver where it counted: Netflix HD streaming. Now, before you scoff at my review, understand that I am running a highly optimized wireless network with several devices, including my Roku XD running on the 5Ghz spectrum. In fact, I went to great lengths to upgrade my network in terms of signal strength and pure bandwidth.Since I have an existing Apple ecosystem I finally gave in and decided to give the newest iteration of the Apple TV a chance. My first impressions are very favorable. I love the wireless display capabilities of the device. I also like the ease of using my iTunes account to access and consume content via the iTunes store and iCloud. Most importantly I absolutely love the way that the unit performs when it comes to high definition streaming via Netflix. Just finished watching \"Ironclad\" in HD with nary a hiccup, stutter or rebuffer...I may just end up using and enjoying my Netflix subscription this time around if the Apple TV keeps performing like it did tonight!If you have an existing Apple rig in your house and an iPad or iPhone, then this is a no-brained and a must have device.",

Netflix works well on the AppleTV, we used the Wii prior to purchasing the AppleTV and the interface and quality of streaming seems to be better on the AppleTV.AppleTV is highly integrated to work well with other Apple products and the iphone has a great free app which you can use to improve over the sleek remote that comes with it.  The nice small simple remote is great for going to quick places but when you start wanting to type, etc., an app like the remote app on the iphone is much more handy.  You can also pair a bluetooth keyboard to make typing even easier, but I haven't really needed that so much.You can also select Apples new internet radio station to play background music and if you have another Apple computer hooked up to the network it will also show a screensaver with your recent pictures scrolling from the photostream.Overall, this is a great product and has more than paid for itself in our ability to cancel our cable service.  The features such as Airplay are amazing and allow you to stream things from your iPad to the extent that you couldn't tell that you weren't watching the actual TV shows on cable.",

    "reviewText": "The Apple TV works well enough, Airplay works alright though is overly complicated for my folks to use on a regular basis with their iPad 2 (it seems picky when using their apps, many of which are in Taiwanese). It's just a rather unspectacular device. Hulu and Netflix have terrible interfaces when compared to other versions of their software, there are no other non-iTunes stores that you can purchase movies from. And no Amazon unless you stream it through your iPad/iPhone.On the other hand, Airplay works well (though by no means flawlessly). iTunes has a very thorough store (though it too could use a facelift), and though added slowly, the Apple TV is getting some better channels finally. HBO Go here works on Comcast (*cough* Roku, wtf fellas *cough*).Recommendation: If you have a lot invested in iTunes or really want Screen Mirroring from your apple devices, get an Apple TV. Otherwise, there are better solutions out there.",

I went with the apple tv instead of it's competitors because my peeps have ipads and the inter-connectivity between both apple products would be extremely useful to them, and so far everything works perfectly. They are able to stream directly to the device from their ipads as well as use the remote app for apple tv to control it as well. The little remote is built like a tank but it is very basic and limited, I would have loved to see more options/features available on it. So excellent picture and audio, and easy enough setup so I have no problem recommending the Apple TV MD199LL/A.Be sure to not select the audio help during the initial setup because the automated assistant voice is annoying beyond description and played way too fast so that it provided no help during the whole time it was on.

I have to reboot the Apple TV so that it gets listed in the list of devices for Air Play. This has happened to me 5 to 6 times in the past 1 month.- A single remote works for both my Macbook and Apple TV. If i operate the remote for Apple TV, the iTunes in my Macbook also responds simulataneously to that remote control clicks.- There was once when i tried to set up my wife's ID as well in the Apple TV after restoring to the factory settings. But this restoration did not help but this crashed my wireless router's security and the router went down. I reconfigured the AppleTV again to my apple ID to restore the wifi router back to normal. So, some function in the \"Restore to factory settings\" is incorrect for the AppleTV.- The AppleTV key board on the screen is hard to use (i felt a PS3 keyboard was even easier to use on the TV screen than the Apple TV keyboard)",

The only thing I find remotely useful is having an iPad or iPhone and watch youtube or amazon instant from it. All you need is to spend another $300 - $400 more to get this functionality. I am very disappointed with this for that reason. The apps/channels are limited. It seems to be yet another $100 accessory to an iPad/iPhone. On its own, I think the market has better products that offer more, like Roku and Chromecast, either better price or more features.I was looking forward to mirroring functionality of this as well, but again I was disappointed, the video pauses and then tries to catchup and the audio keeps cutting in and out. This happened with simple things like trying to play a slideshow from iPhoto. Watching videos or mirroring a game is out of the question. I am not really sure what use it is. Maybe PowerPoint without transitions or displaying something static.If you are an Apple-only fan and have the full apple suite, this product my be for you because I'm sure you can overlook all of these issues that I have had.I would suggest looking into Roku or Chromecast, or if you have PS3/4, Xbox360/One, or a Smart TV, you probably have the majority of what this offers.",

For example, say one night you watch one CBS sitcom, one PBS show, some News and your at 10 bucks!  These are typically 'free' shows/TV on the airwaves people!  Why should we pay?  Oh, and pray that the show your watching is NOT in HD for it will take between 20 to 90 minutes to load!  Another issue...take for example a typical 'YouTube' video, start playing it via AppleTV and suddenly after only a mere 20 seconds into the video it fades out, why?  Is there a copywriters infringement when something 'free' is channeled through your licensed AppleTV device via iTunes store? After a month of pulling my hair in an attempt to making sense of the costly 'free' programming I gifted this device to my folks who were content in using it as a mere interface 'gizmo' between their iPad and their Samsung HDTV. The 'Airplay' option is slow/sketchy to interface with the TV, its a 1 in 3 shot attempt to get a perfect non-buffering lock for video.  For 'stills' however, it works fine; but as we all know,  there are better, smaller and cheaper foolproof gizmos to interface your pics from your computer/smartphone to an HDTV.Sorry Apple, but I agree with the other 195 '1 star' reviewers, your product has a strange 'cost' and 'rights' relationship with free TV programming. Roku is better if you want to watch terrible 'B' movies for free and really for free.  'Googlecast'  merely gathers all the free and paid programming links for you in one place, but for TV and Movies, still,' the best -bang-for-your-buck'  is to get internet service and Netflix.  I have had DirectTV and Comcast service for less than 30 bucks (2014) a month, I pay an additional 8 bucks for Netflix and I get hundreds of 'on-demand' shows in dozens of genres at a instant, in HD,  that I can rewind,  FF, and save and no delay!",

    "reviewText": "The reason why I even bought the Apple TV was because I wanted the AirPlay integration with the iPad (streaming the iPad's screen).As any Apple product, this thing was a pleasure to take out of the box and set up. There is nothing much to say about the setup process and interface, it's very simple and on pair with the competitive devices (I also have an older Roku 720p box).It worked for the first, like, 25 minutes. Until I updated it and opened a random youtube video from the \"most viewed\" category. The device played about a half of that video and simply hanged (went quiet and frozen the picture/frame). I tried to restart it by using the combination of keys at the remote (as per Apple's manual), then by taking out the power supply, then by connecting to my laptop via exotic micro USB cable (luckily I even had it from an older Samsung phone)... but no luck. The Apple TV would only display the Apple logo while booting up and then black screen. After spending a couple of hours on the Internet forums I discovered that surprisingly many people are facing this type of issue. Some users blamed TVs (I have relatively new 60\" Samsung and it works perfectly fine via the HDMI with a number of other devices); some users blamed HDMI cables (so I tried a couple of them with no luck); and there have been plenty of other \"dark magic\" options which I also tried, and which included  disconnecting the TV from the power supply and almost reading mantras. The bottom line is that the problem isn't new but Apple isn't doing anything about it for whatever reason.One wasted evening and I decided that it's not worth it. The return process was smooth and simple (as always with Amazon) and I got a full amount refunded in a day or two. Kudos to Amazon on the customer experience!As far as the AirPlay is concerned (the original reason for my purchase), I found that the feature is only useful for the photo slideshows. I was hoping that I could use the iPad as a full-blown keyboard / remote control for the TV but that's just not how the AirPlay works; this application is only compatible with certain services and kicks in when you start a youtube video for example, it opens it's own interface that intercepts the output from your device... guess what happens as soon as you navigate away from that page on your phone (let's say to search for another video)... it just stops playing it. And not to mention that the resolution and the screen ratio of the iPad doesn't match the 1080p TV... so instead of enjoying the full screen experience you actually end up seeing black borders on the both sides of your TV screen (while broadcasting the iPad's screen).All these TV boxes deliver very limited user interfaces as compared to the real computers with real browsers; I am now considering to purchase a mini-computer for the Netflix and etc. (those typically start at $300 but it's a way better alternative).",

I liked several of the built-in options, including Netflix, very much.  But, I didn't buy this for home...I bought this to use on my boat, to couple movies from my iPhone to my HD-TV.  The Apple-TV won't connect to the iPhone without both devices being on the same WiFi subnet. Nor would the Apple-TV connect to the iPhone's personal hotspot (well, the Apple-TV does connect to the internet, but the iPhone and Apple-TV aren't on the same subnet and won't communicate... STUPID).  So, I bought a wireless router, installed it on my boat... Apple-TV would then connect to the iPhone, but Apple-TV won't work without internet access to verify your phone's movies... STUPID.  Once again, because the iPhone's WiFi hotspot is a different subnet than the iPhone's internet (4G) connection, the two won't work together.  It's such a stupid design that it can't be accidental, Apple had to have done this on-purpose.If you're looking to use this at home, where you have WiFi and you have internet access, this thing is pretty cool.  Try to do something a little different, and this product loses its mind.  I returned mine and bought a Lightning Digital AV Adapter cable, much happier now!",

It ends up as just a simple Netflix box.  Big deal.  The Roku has tons of channels plus you can extend it with PlayON to a heck of a lot more.

I don't have this issue with any of the other devices I use to stream netflix.* There is no volume control.  So I have to use two remotes to watch a movie.  Why?* The remote does not have good range and you have to point the remote directly at the front of the box or it will not work.* From my macbook air I can only airplay from itunes, not from any other app.  For example, using a web browser to access youtube.  The apple tv has a youtube app but it takes forever to type in a search one letter at a time so it is almost unusable.I could go on for a while longer but listing all the problems is making me tired.----UPDATE - Nov 2012----Apple released a new software update for the AppleTV recently and that solved almost all of the issues I was having.

Streaming content or entire screens from you (or your friend's) Apple devices is incredibly easy and quite brilliant.  Streaming music from iTunes running on your PC or Mac is decent.  Photo Stream integration is nice when it works.  Using the &#34;Remote&#34; app on iOS devices to control it is kind of neat.If you don't use the iTunes Music Store for purchasing content, you'll find the entire top row of icons to be useless.  Even if you do use ITMS, it still feels like ad-ware when you turn it on and see a bunch of scrolling advertisements to purchase movies or music.The Netflix player is bad.  As a competitor to the ITMS, it gets second-class treatment.  The video quality is poor and barely ever achieves HD.  There is no &#34;Next Episode&#34; option.  Worse yet, I have several Netflix titles that *ALWAYS* error out on Apple TV but work everywhere else.  The PS3 Netflix player is significantly better in almost every way - especially with regards to video quality and the fact that it actually plays all of the content available on Netflix without error.  Good luck getting Apple or Netflix to support the playback client.The Photo Stream integration is cool - when it works.  I was surprised to find several errors trying to log into my iCloud account, that didn't feel very seamless or &#34;Apple-like&#34; to me.  The Photo Stream option didn't work at all for several days, but after several attempts I did get it to work.There is limited channel selection.  There are several services that will probably never be available on Apple TV because they present competition to the services that Apple wants you to consume.Overall, Apple seems to be somewhat stagnant in this space.  I can't overstate the coolness of Airplay - which can be fun for parties (bring your own music!) but the device is lacking in almost every other way.Perhaps I would feel differently if I bought my content from the ITMS, but this thing is a big disappointment.",

Something to do with the WIFI strength, or Apple wanting you to purchase a newer Mac.  I installed software called Parrot, but the delay from the laptop to the Apple TV was unusable.From my iPad, Airplay worked pretty well, but sometimes would be slow to respond or would stop in the middle of a presentation.  Really not good.With iOS 6, Apple also updated the Apple TV software.  Airplay now works much better.Streaming audio always worked well with the PC, MAC, iPhone and iPad.CONS:1.  You are best using a physical network cable instead of WIFI.2.  Why can't I stream movies or TV from my Windows Media Center library?3.  Why can't I get TV on the Apple TV?  I mean, is it a TV or a Internet video device?4.  Why do I get the Apple TV screen when I want to AirPlay?  It's not very professional.  Can't I customize the background?5.  If you queue up a YouTube video, and go to watch it again, sometimes it won't play.  You then have to search during a live presentation.  YouTube flashes pictures of related video that sometimes contains inappropriate pictures.  Perfect for getting your presentation made without distraction.  (Detect sarcasm here.)PROS:1.  Doesn't heat up like the old Apple TV with the hard drive.2.  Once you get Airplay to work well, it's a great tool for teaching and sharing.3.  Viewing photos on a large screen is fun.4.  Internet Radio is entertaining, although we don't use it often.5.  Netflix streaming is easy, although ROKU works just as well.I would buy it again just for airplay.

    "reviewText": "Problems: 1. Using Airplay with new Macbook Pro (having what is on my laptop screen show up on my tv screen), the sound through the television kept cutting out.. not only when streaming video, but even streaming audio. This is terrible.2. The remote operates on the same frequency as remotes for mac computers. When I use the Apple TV remote, I am causing the computer to do various things. This doesn't happen when I am using Airplay, but otherwise, it happens. I have a desktop computer that I like to have on sleep when I am not using it. I click the Apple TV remote.. the computer wakes up.. I hit more buttons, more things happen on my iMac. This is a drag.3. No direct access to Amazon Prime. If the Airplay function were working properly, I could use my laptop to send the signal to my TV via the Apple TV device, and watch Amazon shows.. but this does not work.. as I mentioned, the sound is very intermittent.I am bringing this device back to the store, and am planning on purchasing a blu-ray player that has wifi built in, and apps for not only Netflix, which Apple TV does have, but also Amazon videos, which Apple TV does not have.--Update 7/4/13: Here is a helpful comment I received, which I am adding to this review, in case some of you do not read comments:\"You can 'pair' individual remotes to certain laptops so that you don't have that problem.\"I have not tried to pair each remote to each computer I have, but according to the above comment, it is possible.Even if I had been able to pair a remote to a computer, and pair the Apple TV remote to Apple TV, I still don't think Apple TV is a good value. If you already have a blu-ray player, but it does not do streaming video, then you might want Apple TV, and perhaps the one you buy will work better than the one I bought.But, if you don't already have a blu-ray player, then you might think, like I did, that it is best to spend a bit more money to buy a blu-ray player that streams videos. There might even be some streaming blu-ray players that cost a bit less than Apple TV. Worth looking into, if you want.Here is a link to Amazon Video-compatible devices. You will have to scroll down quite awhile to find the long listing of blu-ray players that stream Amazon Prime. This is Amazon's own list, so I am guessing it is accurate.http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/devicesI have found that people in various stores that sell blu-ray players are not always knowledgeable about some of their products. I chose a blu-ray player from Amazon's list, and then asked a store salesperson about that blu-ray player. She told me it did not play Amazon videos, but according to Amazon's list and reviews, the player does. I bought the player, a Sony BDP-3100. Here's the link for it:Sony BDP-S3100 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-FiI've only had this item for a week and a day. It does stream videos from Amazon, Netflix, and many other sources. A software update two days ago added over 20 more streaming video channels than it originally came with. The player does not, as of now, stream itunes, and probably won't, but that is fine with me.Since I have not had the blu-ray player long, I have not written a review about it. I'm going to wait awhile to see how it holds up.Hope this info has been helpful.",

In fact, it took Finding Nemo more than 24 hours to completely load using a fast and reliable DSL connection. We experience the same issue when streaming home videos from our iPhone's. Depending on the length of the iPhone video, it usually takes 5 to 10 minutes to load on average. When streaming just plain music, I can literally set the iPhone right next to the Apple-TV and it still 'hiccups' every so often, having to re-buffer the stream. Maybe we're doing something wrong, but this is completely unacceptable in my opinion which is why I've rated this product 1 star.CONS:Other than what's mentioned above, the Apple-TV really offers nothing but premium content (subscription fee content). If you have cable or satellite television, then you really don't need this product. You can't even add or remove apps. We're Amazon Prime members but this product does not support that.PROS:If you enjoy standing in lines, sitting at stop lights, or watching paint dry, then you certainly won't mind waiting on the Apple-TV.",

However, 13 products make much less bloatware on the device. The Box is very shiny and luxurious as it comes to looks. But, When I looked at the 13 products listed, I tried out the movies rentals and the itunes on my computer worked fine in comparison. THe biggest problem is that when I downloaded the product, it did not allow me to watch the movie right away. THe loading time is over 2 hours to watch a movie that is only an hour and 30 minutes long on the lowest settings for internet connections. This was baffling and should not be overlooked. Please save yourself the money and just use your computer to watch movies or a dvd player. In fact, buy a redbox because this product is the least satisfying money I have paid for a long time.Please like my review because of the facts. Thank you.",

Don't think this is a one off \"damaged in shipment\" rant because mine worked fine for a few months and then exhibited a problem many others are writing about online.Their support makes calling a 3 hour support line in India seem like a pleasant solution. Because in this case after you go through your call and endless steps the problems are often resolved. Apple gives you advice that doesn't work, doesn't give you advice that does which they should know and then at some point throws up their hands and says \"sorry screw you\" even though you've invested money for years in their products like content that is now useless to you. This happened to my entire iTunes music library as well. I kept at it but had I not I would have been out thousands of dollars I spent. Apple support cut me loose to my own devices. (no pun intended)Anyway back to Apple TV.This Apple TV worked for months and then recently it started taking content like movies 2+ hours to load. I also have Netflix, Youtube, Amazon and Hulu Plus on my Smart TV and none of them have problems so I know it's not a network issue.I searched the net for hours trying to find out what's going on. It turns out users all over the world are having this problem as well. 100's of pages of discussion and still no resolution is forth coming nor has apple addressed this issue. They have a short support page on it that according to what I've read has helped absolutely no one. It's clear it's still a problem and as of to date silence from apple with the exception that \"yes some apple tv's will be replaced for free\". Sadly my Apple TV serial number is not one of the ones eligable? Why not? I purchased it very recently.For various products including Apple TV I've contacted customer support and 20 to 30 emails later being constantly shuffled around they *still* don't know what I'm talking about. I am very fluent in english, tend to express myself well and have spent years engineering devices like Apple TV so the problem is not on my end. I was also friendly and patient.Recently it started working again but it's a gamble. Say you have a movie night planned with your sweetheart and friends and nothing plays for you that day? It's not a gamble with any other streaming service like Netflix, but it is with Apple. Buying an Apple product means you are at the mercy of your own technical expertise and if I as a former hardware designer and former software designer with a degree in physics can't figure it out, then it's generally not suitable for the average consumer.Yes of course I reset the box, downloaded firmware updates and reset the box, reset my modem, reset my router, updated the firmware on my router, checked all my router settings, did an internet speed check, reset network configurations, spent hours researching on the net, etc. I would say stick with other streaming services but the problem is Netflix and Hulu don't have the large selection that Apple does.One thing you can do is download the entire movie while you're at work onto your laptop hard drive and watch it on your laptop. Then you are guaranteed that you will be able to watch the movie or tv show when you want it. Which would obviate the necessity of buying this box.Or if being randomly disappointed when the screen says \"3 hours until movie is ready to watch\" and you don't mind that by all means go ahead and buy the product but don't expect support. And of course yours could be one of the many boxes that is never affected by this problem, but how would you know?",

They are OK for what the do, and they do work as specified right down to that comfortable feel Apple kool-aide drinkers get with Apple products (I'm not an Apple hater, I have an iPad3 and and iPod Touch).  If this were the only option out there it would be fine, and for $99 it might even be attractive.  However, for under $130 you can get a BluRay player that will allow you to connect with many more video sources and also allow you the option to play just about any kind of disk video media you happen to have around.  I have a $129 (street) player manufactured by Sony and I have yet to exhaust the number of video sources it offers in its standard implementation.  For example, I get Yahoo, Netflis, Vudu, Crackle, Hulu +. amd about 15 other sources (many of them offering free content).  My player plays any disk I insert into it so it doubles as a DVD player, a CD player and a SDHD media player.  It also has connected to each of the 6 WiFi routers I connected to.  So, for $30 the choice was very clear to me.  The Apple TV source media availability is much inferior to my BluRay player and it has no where the versatility in that it can't play disks.  If they offered it at about the $50 price point it might become attractive to some people who have assessed their options.  However, for me to consider one, they would have to price it at about $20, which still would give Apple a fine return on the hardware and they still get to sell you iTunes!",

I am a many years long apple user, fan, advocate, but this ATV (along with iCloud) has me feeling like I've been pushed aside in the interests of fast selling. I say this because: The ATV is dependent upon iTunes. The key here is \"tunes.\" I have lots of video I created with Apple software and most of it, by default, is in my Movies folder. Also, iPhoto and iMovie and Quicktime all are image or video oriented. Why are we using a music software like iTunes. Because it sets you up to buy, buy, buy stuff. My new apple tv shows me icons for Movies and TV but everything in those categories is for purchase. The only way to access my movies or any video I have, is convert it to a iTunes (very limited) format; import it into iTunes, then access it via the Computer icon. But wait, I have to first set up Home Sharing which my Apple MacBook Pro will not do because it rejects my Apple user id (their screw-up, not mine. They have a very old email address of mine which they simple won't let go of).Also...very significant, this new Apple TV 1080p will not play out at better then 720p on both my HDTVs. Why, because, it is p not i. (Google it). In short, it is outputting at a higher or better resolution (p). Now, in most products, if it has greater capabilities than your existing equipment, it usually will automatically play down to that level. I assumed (my big mistake) that since my HDTVs are and do play at 1080i, the apple tv would as well. Wrong.It's a real pain. I can-NOT get to the greatest amount of all the video I have on my three Macs and multiple external hard drives. Unless I convert everything and put it into iTunes. I never understood when people said iTunes was bloated. Now I understand.  (*The cloud thing, well, unless I move up to apple's newest operating system, or get mobile devices I don't want, I can no longer use what I have been paying apple $100 a year for, for the past six or more years.) Waa-waa. Blah, blah. Sorry about the rant. I'm so disappointed with Apple and this ATV.",

AirPlay was fantastic (that still works) - had no problems streaming Netflix - was easily able to Home Share and stream music and movies from my account - then, something changed.  I updated the software - everything went downhill from there.  Cannot stream from my iTunes account (home share) which is initially why I purchased the Apple TV (says I need to turn homesharing on - it's on! - tried everything to get it to work, but it won't).  Next, Netflix stalls.  Doesn't stream as it used to - flawlessly.  Airplay still works, but everything I bought the Apple TV and loved the Apple TV for no longer functions and with each update I hope the issue is fixed, but three updates later - nadda.  Apple Support isn't an option because I won't pay for it.  It should be free. Forums echo similar concerns that I've expressed.  I ended up purchasing a Roku and couldn't be happier.  Hasn't failed me yet - works perfectly - so much so that I bought another (really, for the price of the Apple TV you can get 2 Rokus).  My Apple TV is a useless paperweight which is disheartening.  I am a HUGE Apple fan - own iPads, iPhones, etc.  Love them - but I cannot endorse this product until Apple makes some serious improvements.  On this one - Roku wins hands down!!",

It's definitely not &#34;plug  and play&#34;. I even made a bet with a friend that we'd be watching movies and streaming within 10 minutes of opening the box. He bet an hour. After 90 minutes, I gave up and packed the device and returned it to amazon. He won.Very disappointing. FYI, I bought the google chromecast for $35 as a throwaway to test. While it is not as good using an iPhone/ipad for interface, it's way better that Apple TV. If you have an android device, it's amazing. Apple needs to learn from google on this one. Too bad!",

The next evening, I went to watch the movie and had to download it again.  Over 2 hours (on the lowest resolution) I am not going thru this again.  It looks like apple ripped me off for the 3.99 or whatever the movie price was.Other options are Hulu Plus and Netflix (pay services).  I was previously dissappointed in Netflix and cancelled my account.  I have not tried Hulu Plus yet.The only positive aspect:  Using the \"mirror\" function on my ipad and iphone worked well.

So when I decided to upgrade my ROKU (only 720P) I went right to the apple store and bought two Apple TV's. Man I was stoked thinking how cool it would be to share my screen on my apple tv, listen to my itunes on my Apple TV and even though I am a Prime member - itunes movies will work right sure they cost a buck more than Amazon - but its an apple right.Boy was I wrong.My macbooks were both refurbs so even though they are less than a year old running the newest OS I cannot share my screen on my Apple TV - only macbooks purchased in the past year can do that. The guy at the store told me no pandora, hbo go or Amazon Prime - but the trick was to run them on the ipad and screen share on the apple TV. Fat chance - apple blocks those sites.As for itunes and listening to music - only if you spend $25 a year to push your music to the cloud and renting Videos from itunes - HAThere is a bug that everyone on the apple site is complaining about which cause the movie to crash every 2-20 minutes. So a 2 hour movie requires 30-45 resets.Steve Jobs is dead and so is Apple - new Roku on the way, next phone will be a Samsung and what is all this I hear about Windows 8?",

I have IPods, an iPad 2, a 2012 Mac Mini, and now Apple TV (newest version). It's been well stated that there is not a lot available for content outside of the Apple Eco System as compared to Roku, for example.I've hardwired the ethernet connection to my router from the Apple TV, as suggested, to avoid overloading my wireless capability at home.I'm running the latest version of the OS on the Apple TV, Mirroring my Mountain Lion and Ipad screens is very handy.I've updated my review and added a 4th star because the 'wired ethernet causing content load failure' issue has been addressed. The device needs to have more content available and have it available from the Itunes store. That's the only drawback at this point that I see, and it costs 1 star...I have seen one 'bug' in the current version of the software. Loading select Vimeo content caused an error message stating that the content wouldn't load because my TV didn't support the 'HDMC' protocol (an encryption protocol used by newer HDMI devices). Recommended fix was replugging my Apple TV into the TV. That didn't work. Cold booting the Apple TV did fix the issue.As others have stated, this is a no brainer if you already have Apple products, especially newer ones. If you don't have Apple products, then unfortunately at this time, I could not recommend this product to you, it simply wouldn't have the value per the cost to you... That's the bottom line.",

The best feature on the Apple TV is Airplay with Video. With airplay, you can wirelessly stream audio and video from anywhere on the WiFi network. It's so easy to use and allows anyone with an Apple device (iPad, iPhone, Macbook) to stream their content without having to download software, drivers or connect external dongles.With an Apple TV connected to an AV receiver and/or a nice HDTV, the audio and video quality are top notch. The built in apps like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Vimeo and 1000s of internet radio stations provide great entertainment all in High Definition. However, if it's not on the Apple TV, then you can use Airplay to view and listen to whatever app from your iPhone etc.From a business usage standpoint, the ability to wirelessly stream slideshow or video presentations to any attached video display makes the Apple TV an inexpensive digital signage solution. The possibilities are truly limitless.PROS: Super easy to use and works seamlessly with other apple products. High quality audio and video experience. Airplay is awesome.CONS: Occasional loss of network connection can confuse some users but simply powering off and then back on will fix it. Lack of RCA audio outputs can be limiting for people with older AV equipment.",

I have a vizio 42 inch hdtv with apps and ipad 2, iphone4 as my phone.........the apple tv is awesome. And that is all inclusive. Works grate every day, flip on master switch at plug in every morning and comes on everytime. The HD, is really amazng and with all items mentioned, the apple tv has the best filter for watching stuff thru. I highly recommend the rocketfish ultra thin hdmi cable for $20, really amazing picture. The sound filter in the apple tv is also the best.It has a very sleek remote control , the apple tv is like a control panel for all your needs, music movies , netflix, are the ones I use everyday. The kool thing with the wifi is I can have my ipad and walk around the house with the ipad camera on and it will mirror on the tv. Same with video. The mirroring option is awesome. I tend to just watch things thru the apple tv rather than watch it on my ipad, and mirror to my hdtv, the filter on the apple tv makes it come in clearer picture and sound and puts everything into full 1080p format.I highly recomend is product. Well worth the hundred bucks. Comes in a nice apple box. Top notch. Besides my tv can literally carry all my entertainment needs in a backpack.............I HAVE ARRIVED.And the telefunken stand for the ipad, with all this is a sweet setup that I will have a long time.

    "reviewText": "At less than a hundred bucks, I decided to push the buy button after thinking about it for a couple of generational iterations. I watch a lot of TV, but seldom sports programming. I don't often rent a movie and certainly don't buy or collect DVDs, don't go to the theater often. So why do I even need this? I don't. The Apple TV is a Wi-Fi connected gateway to other web portals like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Go HBO, and Apple store most of which seem to require rental fees or paid subscriptions to get content. So beyond the hundred bucks you pay for this Wi-Fi peripheral you have to really want the content to pay extra to these providers in addition to already having working, Wi-Fi and cable or other internet connection services (which are utility subscriptions as well). Can you tell I am not a fan of the subscription payment model? Anyway, Apple TV will allow me to stream iTunes music content from my 2007 model iMac to my music system on a different floor of my home. The iMac has to be awake and iTunes running, however. Also useful, I can mirror my iPad 2 (won't work with the iPad1) and control Apple TV from it using Apple Remote app, and some apps and web sites can access Apple TV directly from the iPad. I can also display anything in my photo library on the iMac or iPad on the HDTV screen and associated surround sound system. Video and display mirroring from the iMac is limited to models 2011 and newer, very sad, but I knew that going in. I found it desirable to bump my cable internet speed from 1.5 Mbs (that's bits not bytes, by the way) to 5 Mbs another $5/mo, since some trailers and other content took a long time to load. This helped, but I think I would need even faster and more costly speed for some streaming HD content to be viewed without breaks. There is a lot of nickle and dime (read $5 and $10) added costs to getting the most out of this device. That sticks in the craw of this thrifty but honest reviewer.",

Small, discrete, in line with the top notch quality you expect from apple products. I DO wish apple and amazon would stop the feuding and exclusivity rights war to their content, however, as I cannot stream ANY amazon prime content through this and that (quite frankly) sucks.  I'd have to reccommend roku if that is your desire ( and I  can only go by the feedback I've read as I do not own one) as I understand yo can stream ANYTHING through them.

We have 3 Mac computers, an apple extreme, 2 iPods, iPads and only iPhones, there is no droid products and the only Microsoft product is loaded on a Mac computer. This Apple TV works flawlessly with the other products and streams more beautifully than our hd cable does. There are limitations though. We purchase music and video from amazon as well as having a prime membership that forces us to watch prime video through another resource (ps3) while we were once able to stream through airplay there have been limitations created that unable both audio and video to seamlessly stream in unison. There has been additions made to the channels that are very helpful. HBO and espn to go are great additions that expand viewing options exponentially and also alleviate DVR needs for me. I would give 5 stars if amazon purchased products worked just as iTunes products do, but unfortunately they do not.",

Since you can watch Netflix and Hulu on just about anything these days, DO NOT BUY IT FOR THAT.  The best part by far is having your iTunes library available through your TV and the ability to use AirPlay to project your iPhone, iPad, and Mac screen to the TV Screen.You're basically paying $95 to listen to your music through your TV (and I have surround sound so i admit my music sounds amazing when I'm using the treadmill) and project images to your TV wirelessly.  Some say its worth it, some say its not.  All a matter of opinion, I think think its nice to have, but I wouldn't buy it again.  This thing would be awesome to receive as a gift.If you want more content options, like news, HBO GO, sports, things of that nature, go with the Roku HD.

    "reviewText": "Have to say that this is quite a clever box of tricks. Before purchasing, I did a lot of research including Apple forums and other instant streaming devices such as Roku. In the end, it is about personal choices and what works for you. I should also state that although I have an iPhone and the wife has an iPad, we are not committed to Apple products we have to have no matter what. Having said that, I DO like the minimalist styling of both the unit and its remote.The ATV3 is Apple's 3rd version and besides a few tweaks at previous bugs, the essential difference between this version and the previous ATV2, is that this one supports 1080p HD whereas ATV2 was restricted to a max of 720p. To some that matters, but I personally cannot detect the difference from my sofa! Also, when I checked where it was available to buy, the best deal was on Amazon itself for $88! Free shipping and no sales tax, too. Normal retail is $99 plus tax and the 3-4 days wait wasn't a problem either.The set-up was straighforward. Yes, you could follow the booklet that came with it but all you needed, was the instructions on the screen and you were up and running. You can have it set up wirelessly (WiFi, with a router) or an Ethernet cable (wired). My specific set up was I have a NETGEAR dual band WiFi router in the office next door that provides a wifi hotspot for the wife's iPad and my iPhone (when not using Verizon's 4G network). This particular router stated that it was designed for medium to large homes, several devices simultaneously being used and that it supported streaming HD video. My 7 year-old TV is also capable of 1080p HD res.The box comes with the small, black ATV, a power cord and the Apple remote. You WILL also need a HDMI cable to connect it to your TV, if you don't already have one. You don't need to buy a state-of-the art one with gold plating that'll set you back up to $50; they are available for as little as $20 at Radio Shack or Fry's. Mine was one left by my TV cable company when I switched to using a CableCard instead of using one of their bulky box tops.Had the ATV for a few months now and I'm still learning what you can do with it! It's a work in progress. I would highly recommend getting a book on this device, especially one that includes trouble-shooting. There is one available on this site and it DOES cover the ATV3. Having this companion, I found, is very useful and not too technical following each chapter, depending what it is you're looking for.All in all, I have no regrets in buying this product as I already had the other devices with which it runs. About my only criticism is that the library content on say, Netflix, is not as wide as on the regular mail-in DVD. If you do a search on either, you are more likely to find the physical DVD format available as the same movie as instant streaming. Apple's good but even it and iTunes are not 100% perfect! Maybe they will add more content and encourage more consumers. Already other companies are giving them a good run for their money and there's nothing like healthy competition to get a company to give the consumers what they want, rather than what they think they need!!.......",

    "reviewText": "I bought an Apple TV to replace my Roku device on my family's main TV. I've had a Roku HD for the past year and a half which I've since moved to another TV. The Apple TV has Netflix and Hulu Plus on it which is what my family uses 99% of the time. Roku has more channels, but I rarely watched them. I do like having Spotify on the Roku, but with AirPlay I can easily run Spotify on my iPad and mirror it to my TV/sound system. I think this device is excellent for what it does. My only complaint with the Roku was that it was flaky and I had to reset it frequently. Whether that was the device itself or the software running the channel I don't know. Hopefully it's better with the newer Roku devices. I will still use my Roku on another TV. I also have most of my media in iTunes. If you have a Mac and/or several iOS devices then an Apple TV is worth consideration over Roku. I couldn't be happier with it. My kids enjoy AirPlay because one can play on the iPad while the others watch it on the TV. That solved the problem with my oldest son getting irritated by his younger brothers crowding around him to watch him play on the iPad.In summary, I think both Apple TV and Roku are capable devices. Having other Apple devices in the home was the deciding factor in purchasing an Apple TV for my family. If you don't have other Apple devices then Roku is likely a better choice.",

You need a longer hdmi cable, be warned.- Works well with streaming movies and gives you the option to stream Netflix and Hulu which is pretty nice of Apple, considering it's a much cheaper way to watch movies than through Itunes.- When you do buy a movie through Itunes, the quality is wonderful. My husband pays the Verizon Fios bill, so we take turns as to who pays for the movie on demand. Wish Apple would lower their movie rental prices to compete with Redbox- Great for streaming your iPad or IMac onto your TV screen.- There are three different speeds to fast forward and backwards. Again, you would need to read the instructions to know about it.Here are the Cons:- The remote is not self explanatory and you need to read the instructions. I would have preferred to see a button on the remote which was marked \"Select\" instead of just a round silver button within a black circle with arrows pointing North, West, South and East. You need to figure out what that means. For non-techy people, the remote will be an issue.- To go backwards, you need to click the menu button.- To play, if you press the silver buttonBe aware, it needs it's own HDMI input on your television. The better the hdmi connector you use, the better your picture will be. Also, in my opinion, it's better to use an ethernet cable than wireless, especially as our TV area is pretty far from the wireless router.

    "reviewText": "I own both an Apple TV and a Roku 3.  I originally bought the Apple TV but quickly found myself wanting more channels.  As a primarily Apple user, I didn't want to replace the Apple TV because I love the airplay mirroring and streaming from my Mac or iOS devices.  The Apple TV is very fast and responsive, especially compared to the online apps in my Internet capable TV.  So far, I have not encountered any buffering or sync issues with the apple TV.  I originally had it connected with an ethernet cable but after purchasing the Roku, I now run it wireless in the family room.  I keep the Apple TV in the family room so other family members can mirror or stream from their iOS devices.As I mentioned, my only complaint with Apple TV is a lack of channels. The only premium channel available is HBO Go.  However, the only extra premium offered on Roku is Epix.  Also, some of the extra channels are pretty worthless, like SyFy.  Forget full episodes of current and former SyFy faves like Being Human, Helix or Battlestar Galactica.  The SyFy channel on Roku offers nothing more than snippets.  Dozens and dozens of minutes long snippets.  Uh, no thanks.  Apple TV does offer several news, weather, specialty and children's channels (like Disney).  There is no Amazon instant video as offered on Roku.  Movies and television shows that aren't available on any other channels must be purchased through iTunes.  The included remote is small and limited to basic playback functions or text entry using the directional arrows.  A remote app is available for free from iTunes that gives you more flexibility and is much more efficient for certain tasks, especially text entry.  The keyboard in the iOS remote app will make you never again want to use the directional arrows on the bundled remote.  All remotes work through the network, not bluetooth or infrared.  I can actually control the Apple TV in the family room from any other room.  Last week, I was able to display photos from my iPhone two rooms away.  In addition to the iPhone, the app works on iPods and iPads as well.So far, I've had my Apple TV since the end of November.  As of mid-January I have not experienced any major issues with A/V sync or buffering.  It worked flawlessly when I originally had it connected via an ethernet cable.  Once I switched to wifi, I still never encountered any sync issues, however, I'll occasionally get a very quick buffering.  It is infrequent and  doesn't last more than a second or two.  I actually get more buffering delays when watching streaming video wirelessly on much more powerful laptops.If you're trying to decide between Apple TV and Roku, I suggest Roku if you're really into watching online content and want the greatest variety of channels available.  Apple TV currently can't come close to the number of channels offered by Roku.  If you own a Mac or iOS devices and get your content primarily from iTunes or plan to do a lot of streaming /mirroring from your Apple device, Apple TV is a no-brainer.  I actually fall into both categories, so I own both.  With recent sale prices, they were still pretty affordable.",

Setup was a breeze, and picture quality is also excellent, with hardly any need for buffering, but that can be due to cable usage in my neighborhood, or something else not necessarily the fault of the Apple TV.  Anyway, Apple needs to add more content, as I'm sure they eventually will, since Netflix (and Hulu Plus, if you so desire) are the only things worthwhile to me so far.  Yes, you can subscribe to sports programming but I'm not interested in those, and YouTube's quality varies immensely.  You can also play music from your computer (provided your computer is a recent model, and your OS is newer) to your stereo but I don't see the point of playing a low-fidelity medium on a high-fidelity system, and photos can also be streamed directly to your television.  All in all, a great product, albeit, limited in variety, so far.  However, if you subscribe to Netflix for its streaming then it is worth it for that alone.",

    "reviewText": "I've been using my Apple TV for several months now and I feel that I have enough experience with this product to author an adequate and honest review.Pros:Awesome packaging! Your Apple TV box slides out of the packaging sleeve revealing your awesome little black hockey puck of a media streamer. Pulling the Apple TV out of its box reveals the remote made of sleek aluminum. The remote feels solid, incredibly simple and almost familiar. Underneath the remote resides the power cable, sans bulky power block as the Apple TV's power supply is actually inside the device itself, and owner's manual/warranty information.Simple setup! Plugging your Apple TV into power and then into your HDTV or Projector with an HDMI cable (Amazon Basics HDMI recommended, quality at a low price!). You are greeted with a dead-simple interface. Language? Wifi Network name and password? Apple ID and password? Done! From box to Netflix took about 2 minutes, tops.Blazing fast interface! I finally have a replacement for the sluggish \"Smart\" options on my Samsung LED TV. Getting to the middle of my Netflix queue on my Samsung took around 5 actual minutes before we were watching the movie/TV show. My Apple TV does the same job in less than 60 seconds.Features! Streaming options include iTunes Movies/Music/TV Shows (for purchase and for rental), Netflix, Hulu, MLB.TV, NBA LeaguePass, NHL On Demand, Wall Street Journal Online, Flickr, Vimeo, Youtube, AirPlay (next bullet point), and more being added in updates! Since I have owned mine, they have added several streaming options.AirPlay! Definitely something that sets the Apple TV apart from the competition. With a single tap on an Apple mobile device (iPod Touch, iPad or iPhone), you can wirelessly send media content to your TV! You even have the option to mirror your device's screen to the TV! Anything you do on your mobile device can be seen on the TV! Web browsing, Apps (HBO Go and other streaming services that aren't natively on the Apple TV), games, email, documents, anything! Awesome! This feature even extends to Macs.**NOTE** You can get AirPlay to function on non-Apple devices! Download AirParrot on Windows and DoubleTwist on Android to enable your ability to mirror your device to your Apple TV, wirelessly.Connectivity! Built-in wifi and bluetooth connectivity allowing you to connect a bluetooth keyboard for quick login and search entry. Recommend the Apple Wireless keyboard as it is very thin and light, great for couch use!Cons:Missing some streaming services like NFL and HBO Go, though these services are available if you have a device that can AirPlay this content from the web or an app.No native component connections, though this is a rare need in today's HDMI world.My Setup:Cox High Speed Internet 50MbpsMotorola Surfboard Extreme DOCSIS 3.0Apple Airport Extreme RouterSamsung UN40ES6500 40 inch LED 120hz 1080pApple TV (3rd generation, 1080p)Amazon Basics HDMI cableIn summary, this device is well worth the $99. It exceeds expectations in every regard, and allowed my wife and I to become \"Cable-Cutters\" and drop our cable TV service completely. We went from spending ~$150/month on television and blurays, HBO, Showtime, Starz, etc to spending ~$50 with Hulu Plus, Netflix and various purchases and rentals from the iTunes store.

I being the tech geek of the house had my doubts about being completely reliant on streaming which the 2nd and 3rd generation Atv's are. Over the past 2yrs Apple has made major improvements to the iOS and many services (streaming) make the device a great value. In the early days I did feel crippled by the lack of options but that is no longer an issue for example MLB network is now available if you have an MLB account. And then there are the obvious options like Netflix and streaming from your networked computers (that are running iTunes). My guess is things will only get better as Apple continues to add services through iCloud and hopefully streaming of live TV. Even without those the device is a bargain and completely idiot proof. :-)Note you can stream many cable channels via iPad - iPhone - iPod apps in HD. For example we often stream news channels like CNN to our Apple TV on our bedroom TV via my iPhone. However most apps require you have a TV provider... We have Dish sat service (only one receiver in our family room) having that account lets us use apps like CNN to watch their live streaming.Bottom line this is a great device and even greater if you have iDevices in your home.

I was so upset about it!So the solution, if you're like me is that you have to go to your router in any internet broswer by typing in the ip address, log in, and add in the atv's ip address as always allowed.  I don't trully understand why this is, but the explanation is something about devices are constantly &#34;reconnecting&#34; to the router, and this is what disrupts the atv's performance and ruins everything until fixed.  They say modern routers don't do this, but mine is only a few months old, so I think it's a problem with atv that it doesn't work out of the box or at least make it easier to find this solution which it took me HOURS to find.

Thought about returning it then, but decided to wait to see how well it works with a new MBP.MBP (2.6GHz i7 16GB, dual 7.2k rpm hd): what a waste of my time.  I upgraded to ML just for aTV...  Yes, mirroring worked, but not like for viewing movies at full resolution/24fps.  My MBP was 12' from the router, the aTV located 8' from the router.  (btw, a $130 Linksys/Cisco N router).  As for &#34;mirroring&#34;, well, slow at best - most of the time there was a 12 sec delay... on anything.  So frustrating.  I &#34;reverted&#34; back to Lion where Airplay worked for pics...  oh but not so well for vids/movies.iPad 2nd/iPad mini- oh forget it.  Decided to return the aTV to Amazon.Pros:  Can display pics on the iPod/iPad very well on your home lcd.  This has great potential for photo studio purposes if one uses wireless units in their dSLRs.  aTV has really nice screen saver and the menu driven interface is as one would expect from Apple products.  Intuitive, easy to use, high quality.  Wireless configuration was such a breeze!  The packaging for this is second to none.  The included remote works with other Mac/Apple products - very nice.Cons: Video files cannot be some of the more popular file formats.  Basically, they all need to be in Apple's iTunes compatible formats.  Price is a bit high, but consistent o all Apple's products...  ( this would have been my 6/7th Apple product).The concept of being able to display my MBP screen onto a selectable (if you have more than one aTV in your location) LCD in my home/office wirelessly is really cool.  Maybe in the next release this will work.  BTW, for AirPlay works on Lion - you do not have to upgrade to ML.",

    "reviewText": "Pros: AirPlay mirroring, Super Compact, Easy Set Up, Great User Interface, 1080Cons:  Limited Apps, AirPlay mirroring blocked by Comcast/HBO using portable devices (iPad, iPhone), Doesn't work with other devices, no control of AirPlay when mirroring from iMac in other room.My favorite feature with Apple TV is the AirPlay mirroring.  When I am visiting friends without cable, Netflix or Hulu, or on the road traveling, I can easily get access to these shows or live streaming if I bring my ATV along with my iPad and connect to an HDMI device.But, outside of ATV's AirPlay mirroring, I am left wondering what else can I do?Apps on ATV are very limiting.  If you are buying this for the current app line up and not Airplay Mirroring, I suggest buying a Wireless Sony Blue Ray DVD player.  Head to head, the DVD player has far more usable apps than Apple does, it plays DVDs, Blue Rays, and even does 3D DVDs... and cost $130 vs $95.  Well worth the extra $35... but it doesn't do AirPlay mirroring.When using AirPlay mirroring, I am limited to controlling streaming from the device which is being mirrored.  With the iPad this isn't a problem... but if I am using the iMac which is located on the other end of the house, this isn't fun, but is good exercise.  I can't even pause a movie.  If your question is why don't you just mirror it from your iPad, well the answer is that not everything can be mirrored from portable devices.  Comcast & HBO have blocked the ability to mirror from your iPad/iPhone, but not the case from my iMac.  It would be nice if the ATV gave some control to pause the iMac in the other room.UPDATE to Mirroring:  HBO recently updated their app and I can now mirror HBO Go on my Apple TV from my iPad.  Additionally, I have been able to use the remote to pause, rewind and fast forward... or simply use my iPad to control everything.  This is a much better improvement and makes me raise my star review to 4 stars.After getting the ATV, I shelled out $25 for a yearly subscription to iTune's Match.  That was 3 weeks ago and 90% of my music has been uploaded.  The first 80% took a few hours, the remaining 20% is taking forever because the music wasn't matched from iTunes catalog.  I understand some of my music isn't on iTunes, but there seems to be some that is on iTunes that isn't getting matched from the iTunes library.  Match allows me to AirPlay my music from the Cloud in another room with ATV without connecting to my computer.  This is especially useful when on the road.Not all Netflix & Hulu apps are the same and ATV wins easily for their interface.  I have these services built in on my Vizio Via TV in our bedroom and the Sony Blue Ray in our living room.  Apple TV wins easily in user interface.  The Sony comes last in quality.  It is a bit wonky, the layout is weird, and reading titles is nearly impossible.  The Vizio is a bit better, but is also limiting.  The Apple TV is clear, easy to navigate and even gives you extra search features in Netflix.  For example, on some movies you can go to the cast list and click on each cast member to find other movies they appear in. The layout is well thought out and easy to navigate. Great!I have high hopes for ATV in the future.  Coming from Apple, I expected more Apps and they should be delivering on this ASAP.  Additionally, giving the user two way control using AirPlay mirroring is much needed.  I should be able to pause my iMac in another room from my ATV.  Finally, ATV will reign supreme if the user can also mirror and control a remote computer from another room on a television using a keyboard/mouse or trackpad... in essence, giving the user the feeling of having a 2nd computer in another room.This is what I expect from Apple and until then I really can't give it a better rating.",

    "reviewText": "The Apple TV MD199LL/A has two basic functions. It's an audio/video streaming device like the Roku and it's a wireless connection device between your iPad and your television - that's the &#34;Airplay&#34; feature.  My family has both the most recent Roku and the Apple TV. The Roku and the Apple TV have more similarities than differences. Both are compact, easy to set up, compact, have a simple menu navigation system and provide excellent streaming. Not surprisingly, the Apple TV features iTunes store rentals and purchase of music and movies and Apple Radio. The Roku doesn't have Apple Store but basically has all the competitors, Vudu, Amazon, etc.  As a device for streaming movies, I'd give the nod to the Roku.  The ace up Apple's sleeve though is the iPad connectivity. With Airplay turned on I can play whatever is on my iPad (iPad 3 in my case) on my television (projector in my case) through the Apple TV. This makes the Apple TV the perfect accessory for a home theater system. Instead of playing my ipad through it's on board speaker or headphones, I can play it through the home theater system speakers while I carry it rather than have it tied to the charging stand.  I stream a lot of Pandora, Sirius/XM and Youtube music videos. Lately I've been getting into Apple Radio also.  The audio and video quality of Airplay streamed content is great. There is some lag (latency) that makes airplay connections unsuitable for most games.  By the way, I tried playing software instruments on the iPad through using the Airplay audio. As I expected, there was too much latency, at least a full second between when I hit the notes and when the sound arrived. I didn't notice the same latency playing movies. The iPad must compensate on streamed video feeds.  I think it would be great if Apple came out with an Audio-only over airplay mode which would allow a huge reduction in latency.  We'll see if it happens.  I'm giving the Apple TV five stars, because for under $100.00, it's a very useful little box. If you have an iPad and a home theater receiver, the Apple TV will increase your enjoyment of both.",

Once that is done the startup screen will show up. It will want to link to your home wi-fi network so choose that network and use the enclosed Apple TV Remote to enter the password for the network (if you have a password on your network-if you don't, you REALLY should).APPLE MAGIC: Once you have linked the Apple TV to your Wi-Fi network, and if you have a newer version of your iPhone or iPad, make sure that this device (iPad or iPhone) has Bluetooth enabled (check Settings)  and is on the same network as your Apple TV. Then tap (yes, physically tap) the iPhone or iPad on the Apple TV (just a tap, you're not trying to break it) and the iPhone or iPad will link to the Apple TV which will make setup very very easy because you will be able to use the keyboard on your iDevice rather than the Apple TV Remote. BE ADVISED: this doesn't always work so if it doesn't you will have to complete the setup using the Apple TV Remote. If you have an under 25 child in the house who texts regularly, let them use the Apple TV remote to finish the rest of setup; it's so much easier for them!).Once you have the setup completed, use the Apple TV Remote to select options for you.EASIER: If you have a later iPhone or iPad, go to the App Store and download Remote (it's free). This will allow you to link with your Apple TV and not use the Apple TV Remote, which is a good thing.What fun things can it do?If you have a later model iPhone or iPad, you can project the image on your device directly on your television.If you have iOS 6; Click your home button twice and then slide the apps button to the right until you see a small square with a filled triangle on the bottom half. This is the AirPlay button. Tap it and choose the Apple TV as the source. Then slide the &#34;Mirroring&#34; slider to the on position. Within a few seconds your device's screen will show up on your television screen.If you have iOS 7: Slide the controls panel up from the bottom of your home screen. The AirPlay button is labeled. Tap it and choose the Apple TV as the source. Then slide the &#34;Mirroring&#34; slider to the on position. Within a few seconds your device's screen will show up on your television screen.You can watch Netflix, YouTube, Sports, you can stream any media that you have purchased from Apple including Music, TV, Movies, etc.You will find that the Apple TV is a welcome addition to your technology.

When I downloaded an HD trailer and tried to play it, the connection flickered out. I tried two different cables to no avail. the connection would come and go (mostly go). I had never been interested in an ATV, but research indicated that it might be a good way to mirror the Mac. Ordered it, set it up, bang: off to the races (I have a late 2011 MBP, so air-play works fine). It is what it is. I don't do a lot of streaming, so I'm not missing the access to various venues mentioned by others. I like the interface with iTunes. The initial reason for my interest in connecting the computer to my home theater system (such as it is) was the ability to drive high impedance headphones. I also enjoy the interface with YouTube. Those rotating still frames are pretty cool. My often lame DSL is slow to load content (and sometimes just fails) but that's not the fault of the ATV. As for mirroring, my only disappointment is the slight lag time. I work in graphics programs via a Wacom tablet and this slight lag is not a good thing (but I don't mind working directly on the Mac these projects). If my local Apple store wasn't constantly crowded, I would have spent some time at the genius bar to see what's up with the lightening port (Apple Care wasn't able to get it figured out, and I found many blog posts about the problem). Bottom line: For basic use, this is a solid product. I don't regret buying it. Oh, BTW, the free remote  app works great with my iPod 5G. That's a definite plus.",

You must update your Macbook Pro Operating System to Mountain Lion to use it with Apple TV.  Mirroring will not work otherwise.  There is a cost of $20 to do this update and it will change your computer in many ways (including slowing it down and taking longer to boot up).

And indeed, there is a huge treasure chest of video and audio Podcasts - much more comprehensive that what Roku has, and the menu system and search feature are excellent.Yesterday, I returned the Roku 2 XS that I bought at Costco, and bought myself an Apple TV. I can overlook Apple TV's lack of Amazon Instant Video because my Blu-ray player has that feature.Old review:I tried both the latest Apple TV (third generation) and Roku 2 XS before deciding on the Roku.In short, the only advantage of Apple TV is its tight integration with iTunes. I also like its remote controller better.But if you are into high quality, free channels, the Apple TV pales by comparison. Even the least costly Roku LT ($50) supports 400+ channels. The channels that I use most are Amazon Instant Video (Amazon Prime members can watch free movies), Crackle (free movies), Cnet, Revision3, Tested, TED, and a number of news channels.Apple TV does NOT support Amazon Instant Video. It is a closed system, compared to Roku's vendor-neutral design. Even though I have many Apple products, I had to choose the more versatile Roku over the rather limited Apple.You can try out Apple TV at a Apple Store, and you can buy a Roku 2 XS at Costco which you can return within 90 days if you are not satisfied. The Roku at Costco is a special bundle: Roku 2 XS, HDMI cable, and 2 months of Hulu+ free - all for $90. The only thing I don't like about the Roku is its paltry 90-day warranty. Reviews on the Amazon site do not seem to indicate unreliable hardware, so I am not too concerned about this aspect. You can use the Chase Amazon credit card to buy this and get a doubling of the warranty to 180 days.",

So your passion for this device assumes you like/love and/or can at least tolerate iTunes*.A1) Can play visitors music and videos: I assume this only true if they're running iOS devices. Keep forgetting to try with Android bearing guests, but sincerely doubt it would work without special software.B)Truly brain-dead set up (if you bother reading 3 pages of included manual) download it if you lost it.C)Free stuff: Watch/listen to Podcasts, play YouTube, Vimeo, Movie Trailers, Flickr, digital Radio Stations etc. As well as standard paid services (Netflix, Hulu Plus, MLB,WSJ, NFL etc)*Frankly if you're going to purchase an ATV its worth your while to learn how to really take advantage of iTunes capabilities like using smart playlists.CONS:a) They've made your computers media a couple more clicks away than ATV 1 (you used to be able to access from top level (main screen). You have to choose \"Computers\" first..b) Requires Home Sharing (This is a free software service built into iTunes - which determines who can play and or copy your purchased media). While I've never had any problem (even with my PC) some folks (nearly all are PC users) do. It seems this is mostly do to firewall/router settings and/or 3rd party antivirus software. Nonetheless, if you run into an issue, you need to be willing to read thru Apple's KBs on the topic,  (or call Apple and have them walk your thru it if your still under warranty.)c) No way to backdate software without jailbreaking, AND, as of Apple TV Gen 2, you can't disable updates completely (you're asked before updating, but it gets to be a pain constantly clicking \"Don't Update\".)-- A WASH: Pro or Con depending on your needs so YMMV---the Remote: Lots of folks like how simple and small this is. Personally I'd rather have a remote that's less likely to land in the wash. There are actually quite a lot of \"hidden\" commands in the device - like holding down select while playing a video to select chapter, I believe most/all? of these documented online, but personally I'd prefer separate NAMED buttons.No Amazon Video Player: If you don't have another device which has the software, and you really prefer using amazon media only, you might prefer a different device. For me this is no biggy, since I play my amazon music thru the ATV, and watch the \"free\" Amazon Prime Instant videos (well sorta free, since I pay an annual fee to amazon for the privilege) thru my Blu-Ray player, or TV.",

Hurrah!I opted for the Apple TV over Roku products because I'm an Apple user (I've got an Ipad2 and an Iphone 4s, both of which are Airplay compatible).  I'm also an Amazon Prime member who watches a lot of television shows through the Ipad app.  One reason I chose the Apple TV was because of Airplay with my Ipad, I could watch Amazon Prime videos (one feature of the Roku that I really liked.)  Well, it arrived last night, and the Amazon Prime app is not available to stream over Airplay.Well played, Amazon.  Well played.That being said, the Airplay function is worth it.  I used velcro to attach the small design to the back of my small television and the signal from the remote bounces off the wall behind it to the box, eliminating line of sight necessity for the remote.The remote app on Ipad/Iphone is seriously easy to use and cool.  I also tried out a flight simulater game that uses the Ipad as a control panel and the television as game screen (I usually don't play these types of games.  I just really wanted to try out this feature.)  It was fun!",

For example, the Apple TV remote is about the size of a stick of chewing gum, and only has 7 buttons. Sure, why would we need a variety of buttons when we can just hit these 7 buttons 16 zillion times every time we need to navigate through the user interface? I'm sure Apple sycophants are falling all over themselves saying how wonderfully intuitive the remote is, but Apple could come out with a device that stabs these people in the eye every 15 seconds, and they would be blogging about how wonderful and user friendly it is within minutes.Furthermore, I cannot watch Amazon Prime instant videos on it. Apple is always in a dispute with someone, so I am sure this is not a technical issue, but another Apple money grab. These people sue other companies for having rounded corners for crying out loud. EVERY OTHER STREAMING DEVICE WORKS WITH AMAZON PRIME!!! How can anyone say this device is superior when it is the only one that cannot do this.",

Sadly, the Apple TV doesn't reach the same high level of performance as the iPhone and iPad products.  After about three months, I converted from the Apple TV to a Roku 3 and have been very happy with the change.  The Roku simply gives you more channels, has a better interface, is faster, is simply easier to use.  I did enjoy being able to project my iPad or iPhone onto a TV screen using Airplay and Apple TV, but unfortunately, the only way that functionality works is when you are on your home network.  You cannot travel with an Apple TV and expect to use it in a hotel.  You can use your phone as a personal hotspot to establish a network and gain all of the Apple TV capabilities, but you will burn through your data plan very quickly.  If you try to establish your own network using a mobile router then you will quickly find that almost none of your Apple content is authorized to play.  All in all, this was biggest disappointment I have experienced with an Apple product.  Go with a Roku, you'll be much happier.",

    "reviewText": "I don't watch \"regular\" TV at all and haven't for many years so I decided to ditch the cable service and go with 2nd generation ATV back in 2010. For me and the family it was mainly about watching movies and some educational documentaries a few times per week through iTunes and Netflix. Being that we're also a Mac and iOS family with numerous Macs and iOS devices around the house, the ATV became more useful than just streaming movies and shows to the HDTV set. Now with iCloud it's the wireless router that brings all of the content available through the Mac and iOS ecosystem to the TV screen and the home theater audio system. Gone are the big unsightly black boxes and cables that cluttered the TV cabinet along with the racks of CDs and DVDs. With all the content on iTunes Match and the iOS devices, it's just a matter of using the remote or the iDevices themselves to control what you watch and listen to through the ATV.The value of the ATV is that much greater if you have already invested in the Apple ecosystem - Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPod touch, iTunes content, etc. The ATV on its own, I gather, isn't all that great compared to what's already out there. For TV freaks who put in 4~5 hours of TV time per day, I'd imagine there are more thorough and feature-rich devices out there. But as an extension device of all things Apple to the TV screen, this little unit works charmingly well and provides more than enough content for the casual TV watcher and movie fan. I'd only really recommend this unit to iOS device owners and there are plenty of them out there.Apple still has ways to go to make the TV an integral part of its growing ecosystem. One can tell that Apple is getting more and more serious about this business and that it isn't just a \"hobby\" anymore. These little ATV boxes seem more like a real-world R&D; testing for Apple's rumored HDTV set that could arrive near the end of this year or sometime in 2013. The key will be content and Apple still has a lot of work to do on that front. For me, live sports would be the only thing I'd consider to be essential to make it perfect but I know most other people have other wants and needs when it comes to what they want to watch. In the meantime, this new ATV would be a great addition to iPhone/iPad owners and a reasonable add-on for others who want to stream movies and archived TV shows every now and then.",

The Apple TV has exactly the same ports and connectors on the back as before. There's an ethernet port, an Optical Audio port and a HDMI port for connection to your TV. You'll also notice a Micro-USB port, but this has no use for the home user - it's just for Apple's Geniuses to use when diagnosing problems. The Apple TV processor has been upgraded to the A5 chip to cope with 1080p HD movie playback. iFixit has done a teardown on the Apple TV and found that the Broadcom 4330 Wi-Fi chip inside also supports Bluetooth 4.0+HS, although it currently makes no use of this technology - it's possible that the functionality could be added in a future update. The current Apple Remote uses Infrared, this requires line of site to your Apple TV, which can be a pain - a Bluetooth remote would be far superior.Connection to your TV is via a HDMI cable, but be aware that there isn't one in the box, so you have to purchase that separately.The first surprise with the new Apple TV compared to the previous generation is that once you connect it up to your TV is that it talks to you! A voice asks you if you'd like to enable the Voice Over feature by clicking a button on the remote three times.Voice Over reads out what the menu option you've currently got selected is, so it will be a very useful feature for visually impaired users who need extra help navigating the menu systems.Proceeding on, you set up the usual things like language then select a WiFi network - if you've never done this before then it will be your first encounter with the Apple TV's tedious way of entering text and numbers - you have an alphabetically ordered block of letters that you have to have to slowly manoeuvre around using the remote's click wheel. t's frustrating to use because the layout is so unfamiliar - having the letters arranged like a computer keyboard would have been more intuitive.Going through the process of painfully entering your WiFi password one character at a time using this input method only to realise you got one of the characters wrong and have to do it all over again is heartbreaking, especially when at this stage you just want to get on with enjoying all the great content your Apple TV promises. It's a shame Apple still use this input method because everything else about the Apple TV is so easy to use it stands in sharp contrast to other media streamers.",

Now, another feature of this product is to be able stream and/or download movies to watch. Well, streaming works fairly good depending on the sites you go to such as Netflix BUT if you go to the Apple site and try to download a movie to watch, forget it, you might as well get in your car, drive to the video store, rent a movie, go have dinner with family, stop for gas and come home and then \"maybe\" the download is complete.

If you're planning to stream most of your content through one of the included service's apps, you're good to go.  You can stream media from OS X and Windows computers running iTunes.The Apple TV 3 doesn't have nearly the same sort of selection of options and expansion capabilities of something like the Roku platform, but it's not supposed to; it does what it does, and what it does, it does simply and reliably.",

The on screen graphics are also laid out like ever other Apple product, clean, easy to understand.Roku on the other hand is much faster, have a bizillion types of content (even \"hidden addable stations\") that you can add later.  The UI is clumsy, sure - but so what when you have that kind of content made available to you for free!The Bad:AppleTV only allows a hookup with a optical interface or HDMI.  This would prove sorta tedious if your TV only has 1 HDMI port.  On ROKU you have a choice, HDMI or old school RCA (red, yellow, white) plugs.  AppleTV also seriously lacks any way to acccess any really cool information (apps)AppleTV:  NetFlix (paid) HuluPlus (paid) MLB.com (paid) NBA (paid) NHL (paid) Trailers (free) YouTube (free) Vimeo (free) Podcasts (free) Radio (free) PhotoStream (free) Flickr (free) WSJ Live (haven't checked this out yet)ROKU:  The world, literally!  You can add \"unpublished\" channels as easy as 1-2-3!The UGLY:AppleTV is slow!  I have it hooked up via HDMI and it buffers like crazy!  You can't listen to your iTunes music unless you pay $24.99 a year to mirror the music!  ROKU has a cool app called PLEX which will let you play all your iTunes music and Videos and other YouTube videos that you can \"PlexIt\" with the click of a button on your information bar!!  NO AMAZON PRIME?  WTF?ROKU requires a credit card for setup. It's also lightening fast compared to it's elder brother AppleTV.So, right now it's a toss-up with Roke edging out AppleTV to be my favorite, but I'll edit this review when I find out more.",

    "reviewText": "The more I use this the more I love it. I am an owner of Roku boxes, the original Boxee Box, as well as the other common streaming options like a PS3, Smart TV, and Blu-Ray player.  Of all of the devices in our house the only one my wife uses is the Apple TV. I would say simplicity as well as reliability are the biggest reasons why she prefers it to the others.There are little things that I love about Apple TV that put it ahead of the competition. Let's start with the Apps first.  Apple TV has a very different interface for services like Hulu Plus and Netflix and it is in my opinion a superior one. Roku's Netflix App, for example, makes you scroll left to right with just a few titles in your instant queue showing each time. Apple TV shows all of your instant queue titles in one large screen. It is much easier to scroll down and find titles in the middle or bottom of a large queue.  Because of this different user interface all of the screens in the apps are easier to use and navigate.I also like that when you pick a something to watch it suggests several other titles that are similar to the one that you picked. This is very helpful in unlocking lesser known titles in the Netflix library.  Most apps do not come close to showing you all of the titles that are available for Netflix streaming. The suggestions open up the options to things you did not know were there. I love this feature as I have discovered titles that never show up in the main browsing menus.The other big plus is that the Apple TV always works. I cannot say this has been the case with the other boxes I own. I have lost track of the number of times I have had to reboot my Roku or Boxee Box to clear up a problem. This is more of an issue with Boxee but my Roku will often restart itself, lock-up in an app, or just be very slow in general navigation. I do not remember the last time I had to unplug the Apple TV for a hard reboot, if ever.I also love being able to push the up or down button on the remote to see where I am at in the program without having to press pause. I miss this function a lot on my Roku boxes. In addition to your place in the program this bar is useful when you are streaming Itunes related content. Apple TV has 8GB of internal flash storage and begins downloading an Itunes title when you start watching it.  This means you will not see a drop in image quality while watching a program even if your bandwidth becomes less. The progress bar shows you how much of the title is downloaded with a white bar.  If you are having streaming issues just pause the title and wait for the white bar to go ahead of your pause point. It is pretty rare when I need to do this but it is good to be able to see how much of the content is downloaded. If you do not finish a title and come back to it later the downloaded portion stays on the flash storage so streaming is always smooth.Of all the positives mentioned above I have not gotten into Air Play functions.  If you own an Ipad or Iphone, like my wife and I do, then this is another awesome feature. Simply put there are other options that offer more content but there are not many that do it in such simplistic and reliable fashion as this. If you own any other Apple products like a Macbook, Iphone, or Ipad then getting this little box would be a great choice. Even if you are not an Apple user there is a lot to love about Apple TV.",

I like being able to stream photos and music for a screen saver; it's fun having a rotating slide show of our family, friends and favorite pics.  We have also used it to rent an HD movie from iTunes and the download time and play quality were excellent. We don't have a Netfix or HuluPlus account, so have not tried those options. However, we also have a networked Sony BluRay DVD player we use to watch TV programs and movies on Amazon Prime and find them similar in quality and pricing. The advantage of AmazonPrime is the free content, i.e., Downton Abbey seasons 1 & 2 are free on Amazon Prime, but you have to purchase them on AppleTV. We also have Comcast Xfinity and get free programming that we would have to pay for on the AppleTV, i.e., Homeland TV series.  I think AppleTV would be a better product if it included AmazonPrime, but I'm happy with it. I just wish we could combine all these products into one box so we'd have fewer remotes to keep track of!",

    "reviewText": "When I first wrote this review I gave it 2/5.  I've since upped to 3/5.The good:+Easy to setup.+Airplay from OSX works great.  Super easy to get set up.  I don't have an iPhone so can't tell you how well it works from your phone, but imagine it's just as easy.+If you can play it in iTunes, you can easily stream it to your TV.+The remote is nice.The bad:-If you can play it in iTunes, you can easily stream it to your TV.  Yes I did list it as both good and bad.  The problem is that iTunes doesn't support really that many file formats.Want to play a video in MKV file?  It's a popular video format, but nope sorry.Want to play a FLAC?  It's open source and more popular than Apple's lossless format, but nope sorry.It makes for a really crappy user experience when you have to convert formats for the sake of Apple's prudness.  Converting audio is not that big of a deal.  However re-encode HD video in to an mp4, can take considerable time.  Although I've figured out how to encode the video to mp4, and the even faster method of remuxing the video (assuming it's using the proper encoding), it's still more time (and possibly cost) than the non-technical will want to put in to it.  Sometimes the Apple way, is not the best way.-The lack of apps.  It would seem that this is a killer time for Apple to dominate the living room.  However they haven't opened up the Apple TV up to developers, so don't expect to find specialty music apps like Pandora.  However you could always play such services via Airplay either on OSX or iOS.-Does not recognize different wireless frequencies with the same broadcast name.  I've always found this kind of odd, and it's the same way in OSX.  If you want to chose between 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz wireless you must name each differently.  If you're going to steam high def video, or use airplay to your tv you probably want the 5 Ghz band properly set up.-The interface feels old and dated.-Not all Macs or Hackintoshs support Airplay video mirroring.  Luckily an app like AirParrot will allow you to use it.  Airplay sound should work regardless.Conclusion:Overall it's a stylish little box, and you could probably do worse.  If you're happy with iTunes, and can deal with how Apple restricts you, or already have your entire media library in iTunes, then this is right up your alley and you'll love this.  If you buy content from the iTunes store and want a way to play it on your tv easily, you'll love this.  If you have an iOS device and can Airplay stuff to it, you'll love this.  If you're just a huge fanboy, you'll love this.For the rest the lack of choice seems less than ideal.  If you have a large media library that is not iTunes friendly you should spend your money else where.  Similar boxes, like the Roku 3 (but any Roku 2 box really) have a lot more apps, and can play nearly any music or video format with Plex media server.  A lot more choice and cost the same or less.  The Roku 3 should also soon support the non-Apple Airplay called \"Miracast\".After using the Apple TV it for a few days, I'm probably going to keep it.  I find enough uses for it, and have invested enough time in to it to figure out some of the technical hurdles.  I do enjoy Airplay, but wonder if it's really worth the cost of admission.  However that seems to be what this device is, it was meant for you to use some kind of other Apple device to interact with it.  It just, feels odd.  But when you think about it, it should bring unlimited possibilities.I find it hard to recommend.  I feel it's primarily aimed at non-technical people who don't know any better, like most Apple products.  However if you are on the more technical side and have the patience to deal with the technical issues it can also serve you well.  It doesn't seem to fit the middle ground so well.",

It has a pretty easy to use interface and supports full HD (1080p) video. Airplay is a great feature! I prefer hard line connections for security and the unit supports fast GBit Ethernet. I'm a heavy iTunes user, so the content side works fine for me, but I have heard complaints about access to other content providers.The bad: The new Apple TVs do not support iTunes Extras! WTF!!!!!! You can watch movies, but you can't watch the iTunes Extras that come with them on iTunes. One of the most ridiculously stupid things Apple has ever done. Nobody wants to watch a movie on their TV and then go sit at their computer to watch the bonus features. Also, the lack of internal storage means your computer must be on and iTunes open for the Apple TV to work, or you have to subscribe to iTunes Match (at extra cost). With the improvement in flash storage, this thing should have at least 8GB to store music and a little video so you don't have to boot up the computer just to hear some tunes while you're cooking dinner. While the interface isn't bad, it is inferior to the interface on the old Apple TV. The older version was much more fluid and easy to use.",

    "reviewText": "I got this to use the Airplay feature.  I have a media hub in my house so the ability to buy or rent movies/tv shows off iTunes wasn't a big deal for me.Apple doesn't tell you this, or at least advertise this fact, but you need a 2011 Macbook or newer.  If you have an older Mac it will not let you do mirroring, and I'm not sure it will even let you use airplay.  Luckily I have a new MBP, so that was not an issue for me, but just wanted to let other people know as I have seen some people pretty upset it didn't work with their current Mac setup.I really like how easy it is to use.  It took mere minutes to set up and get situated with my iTunes account.  The only complaint I'd have about this stage is the remote takes forever to scroll through all the letters and symbols to enter your user name and password, but thats not really Apple's fault, well kind of, but nothing a nice remote with keyboard wouldn't fix.Airplay works really well, I was very impressed with the speed and sound quality of the streaming from the bedroom into the living room.  I haven't tried streaming anything 1080p because the only movies I had on my iTunes currently were 720p, but those streamed well without any hitches.My only complaint would be with the mirroring.  It works flawlessly as far as picture quality and sound quality.  The gripe I have, and maybe this is just my problem and I haven't figured out how to work around it......but to move anything on the screen you need to actually be looking at the computer and physically moving it.  I guess it was more my fault, because if there is no mouse or keyboard directly connected to it, how is it supposed to know its supposed to move?  I guess I figured something in the Apple TV itself would sync up and allow you to use the remote or something to move around the screen.  It would not, so to change what I was watching as far as a MKV file that iTunes didn't support I had to go into the other room, click on everything, hit play and then walk back out to the living room.  Not a huge deal, because the picture quality and sound was great, when you connect them the sound actually won't come out of your computer anymore and will go right to your speakers so thats nice, which makes me think there must be some way to get a mouse or something working on the screen.Overall I'm pretty happy, but just a few minor complaints.  Its still a great purchase and makes it a lot easier to stream music from my computer room rather than hooking up my iPod to the stereo.",

When you interact with iTunes Netflix- the things the Apple has a good partnership with, it's fantastic. When I want to airplay hulu...I'm not having so much fun. When I want to use my iPad to airplay content available on my PC that I own...I'm not having so much fun.I've downloaded several apps to try to compensate for Apple's lack of integration and plug ins and I cannot get around it. When I use my Xbox 360 for content I have a very good experience, but Apple just only wants to let me use MY content the way THEY want. I do not appreciate that very much. I am done investing my money in Apple and once the market catches up to them (which they will) in phone technology and tablet, a lot of people will see why Microsoft dominated for so many years.",

Wireless connection is great. I love that I can listen to Pandora from my iphone through the Apple TV onto my TV, my kids love it, especially the Netflix, they never run out of things to watch and we have rented several movies from the Apple Store, super user friendly.We are actually going to buy two more, one for our bedroom and for the kids basement playroom.  Make sure you have an HDMI cable, it doesn't come with one and you will need it to make it work, we bought one on here for less than $10. It updates itself regularly, a notice comes on the screen for the update and it takes about 2 minutes.We had considered the Boxy Box, but decided to try this because the cost was better, and honestly we are just Mac people, but this product is awesome!",

The one thing that kept me from getting it was that the previous version was only 720p. Well now that apple released the 1080p apple TV I finally took the jump and bought one. I can truly say I am very happy with it. With the apple TV I can access my music thats on my iMac, and with airplay i can start a movie on my iphone, or iPad and finish it on my TV. I have a ROKU and have enjoyed it for the last few years, but I always felt like it was missing something. I use my iPhone and iPad all the time so having a devices that seamlessly work together was important to me. Netflix is now also in 1080p so I don't just have to use my PS3 to get that kind of quality. For less than one hundred bucks with all the functionality that this little box does it is very worth it.

But, it is still cumbersome to use with streaming data on a home network. It wants to force you into using iCloud and a paid Match service instead of using the content I have right there. Yes, you can go through 5 menu selections to get to your local content but that makes most of the front screen menu buttons just clutter unless you are committed to streaming everything from Apple.The organization of content is just bad. Every season of television shows gets its own listing instead of every show; that makes the listing way too long. Does the streaming TV shows have any real organization and why does it not show all of my old purchases?Furthermore, I am not sure if it will update my media server automatically like the first generation did. Can you even buy music/music videos on this??I repaired my first generation Apple TV and turned off all syncing. Now my system makes sense; it is simple, efficient and keeps my server updated without extra work on my end. I am sad to lose the video upgrades though. But, I do get analogue audio outputs for my stereo.If you have (almost) no content, do not care to use it for music purchases, want to stream everything over the web, it may not be a bad choice if you have never used the first gen. I just have trouble seeing how it could be a good choice for anyone. See if you can get a first generation.Update: I kept this and software upgrades have improved it. Also, I have become more comfortable with streaming everything. I still do not like that I have to pay to listen to music I already paid for. Also, the menus really should be in alphabetical order.",

The Apple UI is somewhat prettier, with no ads, but that's about it. I'm disappointed that after all this time Apple has not paid more attention to the ATV.

But our situation is that the router is in another room, about 25 feet away, partially blocked by a wall.  The result is a train-wreck.  Initially, it didn't work at all (well, it worked for the first few days, then not at all.)  I used the utility Wifi Stumbler (not supported by Apple) to detect interference from other routers, then went and changed the channel on which my router was broadcasting.  Now, it works, sort of.  Netflix movies start and stop regularly.  A 30 minute t.v. show generally takes close to an hour to watch, and there's no rhyme or reason to when the show will stop, and when it will start again.  It obviously destroys the viewing experience, particularly when you have a dramatic scene or sequence, to have it freeze for two minutes, start up for another minute, and freeze again.  YouTube is completely hit or miss -- some stuff just won't play at all.Support was of limited assistance.  I was given several helpful suggestions about how I could spend several hundred more dollars buying additional components to add more routers, drill holes in my walls and run huge cables through them so that the Apple TV could be wired instead of wireless.Thanks guys, but that's not what you advertised, and not what I bought.

No, what I found important here is that with this Apple product, I started to do as I always do and buy directly from Apple's web site.I was on a break at work, I had a credit card already set up with Apple, and I was ready to buy. So I logged in, put it in my cart, went to check out, but they wanted the security code for my Apple/Barclay card I have on file with them. Fair enough... a good security measure I suppose. But I'm at work and my card is at home where I keep it safely tucked away. I never use it for anything but Apple store purchases and I don't carry a balance due to it's usurious interest rate. So, without the code, I have to log off and leave the item in my cart for later.Later that evening, at home, I tried to complete my purchase. But when I logged in, Apple had forgotten that I put a product in my cart. What AppleTV? :D  So I added it back to my cart, noted the $99 plus tax price, free 5-7 day shipping and the need for someone to be around to sign for the delivery unless I planned ahead and did a release form (which you can't do until you get shipping notification.) Eh! Not a huge deal but a bit of a pain and kinda slow. Then for some reason, I stopped before entering my credit card security code and completing the sale... it occurred to me to hop over to Amazon and see if they had this item. Of course they do!Not only does Amazon have the item, it is the same price, but they offer 2-day Prime free shipping, one-click ordering with no hassle or extra verification step, and no hassle with having to be around to sign for it. And not only did I get 2-day Prime shipping for free, the fact that it came via ONTRACK means I actually got it in 1 day instead of 2.I think Apple's online store is great. And I don't have a problem with a certain amount of caution in the security department. But I've ordered several items there with that same Barclay card, had all shipments sent to the same address on file, so how it it necessary to have to enter to security code from the back of the physical card and sign for the delivery on an order like this? A multi-thousand dollar computer shipped to a different address, you bet. But I think some sense and convenience has to come into play.Thank you Amazon for once again proving this is the best place on earth to shop. No, I'm not a shill and own no interest in the company. I just like shopping online, getting 2-day free delivery and not having to fight traffic or lines to get anything anymore.",

After trying several times and failing, despite having entered everything correctly as far as we could tell, we rented the movie through the iPad. It immediately began downloading to the iPad. It would take nearly two hours to download, and then we would have 24 hours to watch it. That wouldn't work well with our schedule. The rented movie can only be played on the device through which it was rented. I suppose it might have streamed through the ATV.So I found the same movie on Amazon at half the price for twice the time, rented it through the Roku, and watched it. To reduce wireless traffic, I put the iPad movie download on pause and let it expire. There's apparently no way to cancel it outright.I probably won't try to rent or buy any media through the AppleTV, nor movies or TV shows through the iTunes store. The offerings seem to be limited, overpriced, overly limited, and clumsily handled.Playing videos and music through Airplay to the home sound system is very handy, and that's the main reason I got the ATV. The mirroring sounds interesting but ends up being marginally useful.",

I wanted to access itunes content and youtube. Sadly I could not log into youtube or my itunes accounts AT ALL. I checked online and others are having this problem. The way to fix it is to buy a new router - I will not because my $200 router is ony 4 months old. Its not my router it ATV, my router works fine with everything else. The two reason I bought it I could not get, very disappointing.ATV is also extremely SLOW taking nearly a full minuet for netflix and hulu to load. The roku interface might be simple looking in comparison to ATV but its much faster. Lastly the Apple TV remote is so freakin tiny - like it was made for tiny people in some tiny alternate universe. If you sat on the remote without any clothes on it might slip up your butt unnoticed (well maybe not:). I really wanted to like the ATV but it was useless for me and I sent it back.",

The single biggest problem is that it's limited to 30 frames per second.  It also limits the number of fields updated. It means you notice a jerkiness to the display.  Motions are not natural.  The sound is fine; it's the drop in frame rate that loses points.In my opinion, it impacts the video presentation making a movie less enjoyable (the reason for the low rating)....stick to DVDs or an HDMI cable from a good video card in your computer connected to your TV.A BD-DVD can provide 59.9 fields per second (like old-time tv) at full HD (a field is a still image that fills half the lines of resolution of a frame).  The Apple HD video format does not provide the full bandwidth.  Running a video encoded for apple-tv on iTunes vs the original DVD, the dropout is immediately noticeable. (The Apple TV supports up to H.264/AVC high profile 4.0; it is suggested that to cover 1080p correctly at least 4.1 is necessary - which, btw, iphone 4 apparently supports.)The wireless network this was on is not highly loaded - it has plenty of bandwidth (802.11-n).Having said the above I intend to use this heavily over the next month as an audio node and based on that may revise this review again.",

All but Netflix or paid video like HULU need a Cable Provider Verification!!!Apple TV just added WatchABC app and you need to have a cable provider to use the app. ABC is a network channel and is free to people who have antenna tv and don't have or can't afford to pay for cable tv.  But on Apple TV the WatchABC app you need to have proof that you pay for cable TV and on top of that AppleTV does not even offer all the cable TV providers including DirectTV, Dish or TimeWarner cable. So this app is WORTHLESS to most people even if they have cable TV or not.Most of the Apps on AppleTV are like this. WatchEspn, MLB, FoxNow, all three Disney Channel apps all require cable TV verification. They want proof you pay for cable tv even for apps where one does not need cable TV to watch the channel.If I had cable what would I need the app for when I can watch it On Demand on my TV...WatchABC app is free on an iPad or other devices but not on AppleTV.So is FoxNow, NBC players but not free on Apple TV.In my opinion Apple TV sucks. Pretty worthless if you want to use apps.The apps Apple TV has are so few with several in chinese or japanese so if you don't speak those languages you can't use those apps.AppleTV is only good for Netflix, Hulu, and  iTunes purchases.Instead buy a Google ChromeCast device USB port device for $35 and get the same mirroring of apps as Apple AirPlay does. Much cheaper and the picture quality is fantastic. Just mirror your apps from your mobile, iPad, Android or computer device to your TV...Then you don't need cable TV subscription verification.Don't buy this unit.",

Last year, I experienced many video stoppages, and skips, and generally bad video performance. They must have fixed these problems because I have had no issue for almost a year.The bad, while you can stream video from Ipod and Ipad to ATV - you cannot stream them from your Imac or your MBP. YES I know you can use silly Itunes - however, I HATE ITUNES. I refuse to use Itunes because it is too controlling - it wants to become the end all be all media center. I deleted Itunes shortly after getting my MBP because it would not allow me to burn any of my music without my credit card info. It was my music I paid for previously and I do not give out my credit card info!Sadly, without the capability to hookup to my MBP, I can only give this product a 2 out of 5.

As it relies on communications back and forth between the sending device (iPad, iPhone, etc), it unnecessarily clogs up your network with traffic.

    "reviewText": "I owned a Sony Blue-ray (model: BDV T58) with wifi function.  I recently purchased this Apple TV because I want to mirror my Mac Air and iPad screen to the Sony Brevia TV (no wifi function).  So, after comparing these two products, here is my observation.Sony Blue-ray has many more channels by 10 times compares to Apple TV, including the unpaid/no-need-for-subscription Crackle (ad. occurs every 15 mins).  Also, if you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Instant Movie on Blue-ray, but not on Apple TV.  The only movie channels on Apple are iTune and Netflix.  If you like TV shows, Apple TV also has Hulu Plus that costs just as much as Netflix online streaming.  But that is pretty much it for Apple TV.One huge advantage of having an Apple TV is that you can actually use keyboard to enter the name of the youtube video or name of the movie/TV shows or whatever.  If you own a bluetooth Apple keyboard, then you can easily connect it to your Apple TV (it is a no brainer, super easy to do).  Don't underestimate this feature, because a lot of people, including myself, have already given up on searching videos on YouTube or Netflix using a Blue-ray, because it is a pain in the neck to use remote control to enter each letter of the keyword or song/movie/video title.If you have subscribed to Netflix and have high-speed internet at home (download speed is greater than 10mbps), then Apple TV gives you super HD quality picture (1080) when you watch a movie.  The blue-ray I own is visibly not as great as Apple TV when it comes to HD movies on Netflix.  However, if your internet is slow when you use Apple TV, then multiple problems occur when you watch HD movies, including in-synchronization between audio and video, video stops frequently and screen turns black, video lags and so on.  One solution might be to use ethernet cable instead of wifi.The set-up for Apple TV is easy - all you need is a HDMI cable (purchase separately) and a TV that has HDMI input.  The mirroring function of your iPad/Macbook/iPhone/iPod to your TV can be done in less than a 1 sec.  There is no requirement for set-up.  All  you need to do is to connect the Apple TV to your TV and power, and the icon for mirroring function will automatically shows up on your other Apple devices.  I've had a lot of fun with the mirroring function with my cat, he truly believes now that there is a huge rat lives behind the TV screen because I played a lot of rat videos on my huge Sony TV through mirroring function via my Mac Air.If you have a PC and no Mac, then there is no question about it that you should choose anything but Apple TV.  I have a Windows 7 PC laptop, and I can stream movies to my Sony Blue-ray through the windows media sharing client function.  However, it does take a bit of effort and time to set up.  Not nearly as easy as Apple TV Home Sharing.  So, if you have a Mac and you want to stream movies or videos, then your best bet is Apple TV.  However, if you have a PC and want to stream videos, then you must use Blue-ray or other Windows compatible devices, unless you have purchase movies directly on iTune, then it is ok.Finally, Apple TV does not take blue-ray disk or any other DVD.  Also, to my surprise, if you try to play DVD through Airplay, it won't work either.  So, if you play DVD every now and then, then Blue-Ray is your best bet.After testing out both the blue-ray and Apple TV, I think these two devices aim at different population and they do several different things as mentioned above.  I am glad I got both and I do NOT feel like they are redundant technology.",

We've migrated from Windows over the last few years, much to the chagrin of my Microsoft employed brother in law and are more than satisfied with the move.The home sharing feature allows us to access all of our photos and videos which are stored on our Apple Time Capsule.  We can also throw content to the big flat screen from our various hand held devices and of course, access our music library and the various on demand services that Apple TV does support including Netflix and Apple's own iTunes store.  These functions were the reason I purchased this since we already had a Roku which provided the same content and then some including Amazon Prime and is also a great device.The remote control is a work of minimalist art which allows you to navigate the user interface with just a few buttons.  This matches the design of the unit itself which is a simple hockey puck sized black plastic box whose light weight allows for it to be mounted discretely with just some adhesive backed velcro.  You can also use your iPhone as a back up remote once you install the app.Over all, this is a great unit to add to an Apple household due to its ability to let you share content, access your iTunes library, etc..  However, if this isn&#8217;t important to you a Roku might serve you better.  Google also has a new streaming device on the market that certainly warrants a look.",

AirPlay Mirroring simply did not work for me despite countless hours of online research and having conversations with users at Apple's discussion forum and the Mac Rumors forum.The Beamer app (a 3rd party app) worked for standard definition content but not for HD movies. The company that makes Beamer blames my relatively new MacBook Air. I seriously doubt that.User interface is ugly too. Just a bunch of tiles that are clunky to navigate.The one time I rented an HD movie from iTunes via the Apple TV it would not start playing for at least an hour. I thought movies were supposed to start after a few minutes. I'd rather rent from my cable company via VOD.I'm sure the Apple TV is great for many others. I'm a huge Apple fan myself. But for my needs it was a disaster. Probably going to purchase a WD TV Live Media Player at some point.UPDATE: Okay, I'm updating my review because I found two apps (Infuse Pro and Air Video HD) that essentially allow me to AirPlay natively (not AirPlay Mirror) video files to my TV via my Apple TV.This is huge for me. It's essentially the only reason I bought my Apple TV to begin with. It really sucks though that AirPlay Mirroring really isn't an option for many of us when it comes to streaming our video content. I feel like Apple is really not being honest on that front.Also the interface as of the summer of 2014 for the Apple TV is simply gross. Even if you can delete channels it's still ugly and a poor user interface. I suspect this Apple TV will get a software facelift come fall of 2014.So yeah, thank you Infuse Pro and Air Video HD for allowing me to use this device as I intended to all along.",

Before this we had a Roku (that we moved upstairs to the bedroom TV) that could stream Amazon prime videos, connect to HBO & showtime GO, Facebook, and gives you endless options of channels to purchase. Apple TV gives you NO options other than the standard few things it comes with (I hope you like Youtube, Netflix & Hulu bc that's it!). Also, most annoying, the remote control is freaking TINY. I mean, MINISCULE. I get it Apple, you are sleek & cool, but it is really NOT cool when I can't find the damn thing every morning when my kid wants to watch tv.

You can play your iphone music on it.  It will also play netflix.  It's only in the past year or so that it does anything else and it still seems limited compared to the Roku 3.It worked fine for the most part during the past 2 years, but there were several times when it needed to be rebooted because it wouldn't show up in the list for Airplay on my other idevices.  About a month ago it simply lost connection to the wifi.  I rebooted and it reconnected - for about 10 minutes.  I did a reset and it reconnected for 10 minutes.  I then did a restore with the latest software and it reconnected for about an hour.  I then plugged it into the ethernet cable and it reconnected for 10 minutes.  The thing is basically a hocky puck now.I went out and bought a Roku 3 and this thing is amazing.  I can use Plex along with the other items that Apple tv allows (Netflix, Hulu, HBOgo).  Plex alone makes this thing worth it.  It also allows you to play your iphone music on the device, but it will not play any purchased movies from your iphone on the Roku - that is the only downside I have come across.  But who really does that anyway?  It also has a wifi connected remote that allows you to put the Roku completely out of sight.  And the Roku 3 is very fast - I have never noticed any lag moving through the interface.If you are on the fence about the 2 devices, do yourself a favor and get the Roku 3 - it is much more capable.",

    "reviewText": "Very disappointed in the product, and plan to return it immediately.  It's a great concept, poorly engineered and supported.  Really, this review is not just a review of the AppleTV alone, but also the iTunes home sharing concept, which the AppleTV is very dependent on and is essentially worthless without.Home sharing itself is very quirky, with all kinds of little issues which prevent it from being totally reliable or really easy to deal with.  In spite of Apples normal intuitive user interfaces, the design of home sharing is clunky, poorly executed, and terribly supported.  In this particular case, one of the issues is that many many people (unfortunately including myself) discover some sort of application defect whereby after 5-15 minutes of use, iTunes/Home Sharing kills the host PCs wireless interface.  Keep in mind that this is on multiple test units, on multiple wireless networks, using multiple operating systems and multiple routers.  It is quite consistent.  Even on Apples forums (and many others) people have been unsuccessful in determining what factors lead to this to isolate root cause.  In my case, this is supposed to be a \"convenience\" item, and I've wasted more time than it's worth trying to deal with it, so I'm done.  I've attempted multiple times to engage Apple, however those efforts have been frustrating and totally unsuccessful.In particular, this makes it even worse as Apple TV is so restrictive as to what you can actually play through it.  Most of us already can stream netflix (if we wanted to) and a myriad of other sources.  The idea was to be able to stream video content from iTunes, and unfortunately, this device is simply ineffective.I did give it 2 stars instead of on, because if you put the host PC on a wired network, it seems to alleviate the issue.  And before anyone comments to the contrary, this is the absolute ONLY function that the networks and hosts in question have any issue with.  These networks and devices routinely move FAR more content and FAR larger data sets/files via wireless than anything iTunes does.  The issue is clearly, concretely, Apple TV and iTunes - period.  Even Apple support finally acknowledged that.Some people are able to get this working well - nobody seems to understand why some have issues and others don't.  My advice is to really test the heck out of it if you're going to try it, so you can make sure you can return within the window.  Further, make sure you understand exactly what it does because it's much more narrowly focused than you might think in terms of capability.",

I use it more than the average person because I do not have cable or even antenna tv by choice.  i have a very large tv screen but use it for movies and apple tv only.  i have to say up front that if you don't have netflix and don't want it, DO NOT buy this thing.  this little black box should basically be called the Apple Netflix Client or something.  beyond that you have the ability to watch youtube videos (duh, even your phone does that at lightning speeds now - but then.... it can also bring you netflix now)  and if you have like an NHL or NBA account where you pay those buffoons more money to watch a sport, you can, idk, watch them on this thing.what i wrote this review to complain about is the very thing this little box should be best at, but in fact it sucks at the most.  Connecting with your Mac computer and playing movies/music/podcasts, etc.  it can do this, let's be clear.  that is a major selling point for this item.  it extends MOST (but not all) of your Mac's content to your tv.  cool.  but only so cool if it works 40% of the time.  basically, if you're on your computer and you add ANYTHING to your itunes library and then want to view it on your tv, the apple tv will tell you you have to turn on home sharing on your itunes.  even when it is clearly still on.  this stupid little box will insult your intelligence and get you so frustrated you will be at an apple store within a few days, and they will tell you there is absolutely zilcho they can do for you.  added: it will even do this if you so happen to turn on your Mac while the apple tv was already turned on.  good luck.  you have to engage your mac products in a certain order i guess, or suffer the consequences.this product has connectivity issues - and the ONLY way to resolve these issues is to yank that power cord out from the back and start fresh (allowing it to restart which takes just about as long to boot up as my 27 inch IMac WTF) just to be able to view a newly added item from your itunes list.  CRAP.  not like Apple's reputation at all.  really, really, crappy.  you'd think if it had these issues one of the abundant \"geniuses\" at this company would have thought to make it at least easier to restart somehow.  how about a switch?  you know, like most electronics?  oh, what's that?  apple isn't most electronics companies?  I DONT CARE I SHOULDN\"T HAVE TO SUFFER FOR YOUR STYLISH REPUTATION.  make your product work, then make it look all space-age and overly simplistic.  make it reliably connect to your OTHER products, like you say it does, then sell me glamor and chic.now, you may be reading this and thinking, well, mine doesn't act this way.  i don't care.  the fact is, mine certainly does, and since the people at apple tell me it isn't defective and therefore won't assist me in solving the problem, i have only one way to view this product, and that is as a totally functioning, totally ill-designed piece of garbage.  i think they care very little how this product performs because they know that at 100$ it's almost the cheapest thing you can even buy in an istore, so it's going to sell no matter what.thanks.",

(To be totally upfront this was a refurbished model that I was assured by Apple would function exactly as a new one would. So I trust that the fact that it was refurbished was not the problem.) My internet connection was working as it should. My home network was also working as it should. I was able to watch Netflix movies with no problem - no streaming issues, no buffering issues, no issues at all!! But, the airplay feature on the Apple TV was not working properly. I was not able to airplay movies from my iPad or computers to the Apple TV, even after spending a lot of time on the phone with Apple Care. The people I spoke to on the phone could not easily solve the issue. Their only thing they could recommend was to \"restore\" the Apple TV. This took over an hour and required re-doing three sets on User IDs and passwords - a frustrating process with Apple TV. Unfortunately, it didn't resolve the issue. It actually made it worse! I called back, explained the situation, and was transferred to another person. He had no answers but would check with someone else for assistance. We were cut off. He didn't call back even though he had my number. I waited 10-15 minutes and called back myself. I eventually got transferred to someone who would try to get me to the previous tech person. In a short time, we got cut off again. There was no call back. There was no email sent to me as a follow-up.This morning, I brought the Apple TV to a local Apple Store to return it. My home network was working as it should. Any software issues were addressed with the \"restore\". Therefore, it seemed rather logical that the problem was a hardware issue. BUT, at the store there was no offer to exchange my unit for a new one to see if that was, in fact, the problem. I would have appreciated the offer and given the new unit a try. As it was, I left the store with a refund, but no Apple TV, and a somewhat negative feeling about Apple, in general. Apple Care offered no solution. Neither did the store. I am very disappointed in Apple customer service. I expect more from them. And, just for the record, I have been purchasing Apple products for 30 years. My first computer was an Apple IIe.It seems there is a problem with the newer versions of the Apple TV, problems that Apple hasn't addressed. Purchasing one at this point is a gamble. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't. I would recommend waiting for any purchase until there is a solution and the product is reliable.",

    "reviewText": "If you want to be able to watch movies and TV programs off the internet on your TV set you have two options.The first is that you can buy an Apple device and get iTunes content. That'll work if you live in a country that Apple acknowledges.  Except that you won't be able to do very much with the content, like play it on some other media player software (one that allows you to copy your DVDs as well, for example) or copy it to another device to watch outside your home, or migrate it to a new device if you need to.  It'll also cost you a surprising amount of money, but in the event the download is corrupted or deletes itself there is no support. And it will take a while for new content to become available, and your friends in one country might be able to watch something that you in your country can't.The second is that you get it off a pirate web site in which case it doesn't matter where you are or what hardware or software you are using, won't cost you anything, will let you decide how and where to watch it, will be available more quickly and will look just the same on the screen. And you won't have to provide your complete biographical profile or create an account.My point is that Apple (and other content providers- don't even get me started about Sony) make it so hard to get content legitimately without offering a single advantage. They all go on about how piracy is stealing, well that is their entire business plan! In order to avoid \"stealing\" we should choose to watch overpriced content with strictly limited functionality- or not watch it at all because we're in the wrong country. In other words we have a moral obligation to jump through hoops and provide them with big profits.That doesn't sound right to me, huge corporations taking the moral high ground. I could have gone along with paying the money if the functionality and availability was the same as it is for illegal downloads. In fact for a long time I only downloaded illegal copies after I'd bought the legitimate Apple TV content. I thought that was a morally acceptable alternative. But now I live outside of the US and the content just isn't available so I can't do that anymore.  I can walk into any store in the US and buy a book, CD or DVD and take it to another country, but I can't download that same movie from that country. Since Apple (and the other content providers) have made it impossible for me to buy from them, how can I be costing them anything if I download it illegally?So now here's what I do: I download the content illegally and watch it however and wherever I choose, then I either send the author/ director money by paypal or through their website, or I make a donation to a charity on their behalf and mail them the receipt and a note explaining it and pointing out how absurd and outdated business models are stifling their industry. I pay them half what Apple charges, which is more than they would get otherwise, and Apple gets nothing.",

The photo streaming is nice if you have flikr or icloud, but is clunkier than you would expect to set up.

The only problem is poor quality, especially the wifi connection.  The support forums are full of horror stories with this device.  My wifi just stopped working after 9 months.  Trying to get warranty service for it, but its really a poor showing from Apple.

For me though being an Amazon Prime member, and a Hulu+ member the fact that Apple TV doesn't Support either is a pain.Another thing that is a bummer in the iTunes ecosystem is the price.  A quick glance at Amazon vs iTunes on a movie like The Avengers shows that iTunes rental costs $1 more, and to buy the movie costs an additional $5 over Amazon.  I can't figure out why that is.Basically, if you are heavily invested in Apple and iTunes you will love this device.  It has the slickest UI and operated Apple smooth.

    "reviewText": "The main reason I purchased the AppleTV was for the Airplay feature. Shipping with AmazonPrime is always fast so I received my product on time. Installation for the AppleTV to my Home Theater System was very simple. Make sure you have an HDMI cable ready because this does not come with one. (I didn't have an extra one so I had to buy another HDMI cable online which prolonged my AppleTV usage for another 2 days) The Airplay feature works amazingly great! I'm very surprised of how easy it was to actually use this feature. At first, I thought I had to install a software, but once the AppleTV was connected, there was an Airplay icon that appeared on my Macbook that I click and BAM! Your desktop is on TV. Resolution on the TV is very nice and it also sends the audio to the TV. I connected this to my Home Theater System so the audio is surround sound as well.The only complaint that I have is when you're connecting to the Wifi, it does not scan for available networks; therefore, you can't click on the available SSID and connect to it. You physically have to type the EXACT SSID. This took me a while because I didn't capitalize a letter, forgot to put a symbol, didn't put correct spacing...etcAlso, I already had the remote control for my macbook pro (Remote configured to my macbook) so I decided to use this remote instead of the one that came with it.Since the remote is already synced with my Macbook, every time use the remote to go through the AppleTV, this would also increase/decrease the volume for my Macbook which was a bit annoying.Photo stream works just as great as it did with my iphone and Macbook. (It does take a while to load all the photo stream photo's onto the Apple TV)The movies that were being offered through the AppleTV were a bit pricey, but that's what Redbox is for.My only intensions of using the AppleTV is solely for Airplay. Once you set everything up, usage is simple and I'm glad that I purchased the AppleTV.Another fine product from Apple!",

    "reviewText": "Apple arguably has the best-developed video ecosystem in the business. Their video rental selection is top-notch, you usually get iTunes digital copies with the Blu-ray combo packs you can buy, a good (not great) selection of TV shows are available, there's tons of great free content (news, vlogs, etc.) via Video Podcasts and Apple's developed a way to stream what's on your iPad 2/3 or iPhone 4S screen to an Apple TV via a technology called \"AirPlay\".I personally have around 100 iTunes movies and it's great to be able to sync them to my iPhone/iPad for my kids to watch when we're out and about, then come home and stream them to my TV with a push of a button.As you'd expect with Apple, the interface is top-tier. Sure every Blu-ray player and game system out there nowadays has YouTube, but usually the interfaces are clunky enough that you rarely use the feature. Apple TV's Netflix interface is also my favorite of the plethora of streaming devices I tried!If you have a lot of iTunes video, a Netflix subscription, rent a lot of movies (but hate driving or waiting for the mail), or watch any Video Podcasts, it's surely worth dropping $99 on this puppy.However, it's not perfect. First, while this is the first \"1080p\" Apple TV, you shouldn't expect Blu-ray quality (as is the case with any current media streamer). Blu-rays pump out up to 40 Mbps of data to your TV, while Apple suggests you have an 8Mbps connection for their \"1080p\" content. Thus, while the resolution is technically full HD, movies have to be so compressed that they lose a bit of color depth and sound quality in order to make streaming over the internet practical: in short, this device is about convenience more than quality.Also, while Apple TV supports a lot of content that no other media streamer can (iTunes video in particular), there are some services notably absent from the selection. For example, there's no Hulu+ and no way to download it since the Apple TV has no App Store.The good news is that you can partially overcome this limitation with the video mirroring \"AirPlay\" feature of iPad 2/3 or iPhone 4S. The bad news with these devices is that the experience is suboptimal. Using Hulu+ as the example, the first thing you'll notice is that the aspect ratio of the iPad and an HDTV is different, so you get black bars on the sides. The picture is also relatively low quality, but it does the job.Nevertheless, since a lot of Blu-ray players offer Hulu+ and even apps, it puts the Apple TV at somewhat of a functional disadvantage in some respects.However, even with its limitations the reality remains that Apple TV is my go-to device for Netflix, YouTube, movie rentals, iTunes streaming, video podcasts and even Flickr slideshows of family photos. What the Apple TV offers, it offers better than any other device I've tried.",

As far as Netflix is concerned, I can't imagine going back to watching on my laptop now that I have this hooked up to my TV.**The only con/drawback I would say is that mirroring and video playback via your iPhone/iPod/iPad does depend on the strength of your WiFi network.

I was eyeing on this because of its AirPlay, Youtube HD streaming, Mountain Lion's Airplay and possibly also for XMBC.Pros:o Simple to setupo remote is intuitiveo Can use \"Remote\" app to control and to type texto Low power consumption compared to my PS3Cons:o The usual complaint - less contents.o compared to PS3 Netflix - same HD content* Not impressed with the clarity* Streaming is not smooth and buffers often(I have connected my ATV3, hardwired to ~30Mbps internet connection)o Airplay videos from iPhone 4S (using n) takes forever to play* Looks like it downloads the entire video and plays.Still keeping the box, hopefully I can airplay using my iMac once Mountain Lion is released and possibly I should be able to install XMBC ;)Overall I am ok with this box.",

I gave it a noble try, but ended up returning this brick.  Since the newer Apple TV doesn't have any onboard storage, or any way to connect external storage, a computer has to be running any time you want to watch your own content (or listen to your own content without paying for an Apple cloud subscription).  &#34;Okay,&#34; I thought, &#34;it's the latest and greatest, and I have an old Mac mini I can leave running all the time.&#34;  Big mistake.  Not only was it a pain to set up, it kept losing its connection to the computer ON A HARD-WIRED, GIGABIT NETWORK!!!  Every time it would drop, I'd have to go to the computer and re-start iTunes, and point iTunes back to the photos folder I wanted to display on the Apple TV.  If that wasn't bad enough, the Apple TV has such a small photo cache that the screen saver displays the same few photos over and over.  It isn't even smart enough to go and grab a handful of different photos from the folder that iTunes is pointed to.  Instead of enjoying my media I spent all my time being an IT tech.  Not fun.

But honestly, its just the 1080p thats the upgrade, but it's well worth it. You can see the difference easily and Airplay for me is a little bonus. If you sell your second generation Apple Tv on amazon it'll cost you about $30 to upgrade, if you sell your first gen (160gb) it could cost you as little as $6 for full high definition, and considering that 720P HD and 1080P HD on iTunes cost the same, if you settle for less it just seems like your getting ripped off.EDIT/UPDATE:As of July 31 2012 the Apple TV now comes with Hulu Plus, making it (for me) the perfect product.AirPlay has worked fantastically for months, I'm extremely happy with iTunes movie/tv show selection and the quality of it all as been amazing.",

Just to make sure you don't fall in the same boat, here are a couple things to consider before buying -Navigation -  Navigation works fine, but typing does not. Using a four direction pointer to type will quickly frustrate you and bring back nightmares of trying to type your name on the high scores list of an old Nintendo. Just because this has the best navigation on the market doesn't mean it is good. Call me when this gets Siri voice input. In the mean time, I'll hook up my mac mini and use a keyboard.Content - Awesome if you use Netflix and iTunes. Not so great if you use Amazon Prime and streaming music services like MOG or Spotify. I know I can airplay music from my iPad or computer, and that really is awesome, but even more awesome is having that content natively supported. Roku has it, Apple TV doesn't.I have huge respect for apple devices and have always been satisfied in the past, but this one just doesn't do it for me. Maybe once Mountain Lion comes out with its native support for Airplay of your Mac screen I'll give this another look. Until then, I'm returning it for a Roku.---April 2012 Update---Just to follow up, I never did get the Roku. As commenters pointed out, it just has different shortcomings. I've had my mac mini hooked up to the TV since though, and I'm pretty convinced this is the best \"interactive-TV\" option on the market right now.

This device has a manual sleep feature.2. This device does not get hot like the Roku Does.3. The quality of the streaming from Apple is second very good.4. The Quality of streaming from Netflix is Superb better than my Roku.5.Access to my Itunes purchases over the years very nice.6.Air Play and screen Mirroring very cool anything I can play on my laptop including instructional videos and materials for school can be placed on the big Screen.7. Built in UTube player very useful when looking things up.Things I do not like about the Apple T.V.1. The remote Apple likes to rely on style but it has exceeded itself this time Blending Style and being cheap have created a tiny  unwelcome easy to loose remote for the Device. The buttons are recessed into a thin aluminum rectangular remote that fits a child's hand better than an adults.2. Supply your own HDMI Cable one does not come with the Apple T.V.Things I like about the Roku Player better1. The remote is simply better it has earphone Jacks that allow you to watch T.V. without disturbing others.2. The remote feels like you actually have something in your hand and is great for playing Angry Birds with on the Roku.3. Unlike the cheapskates at Apple Roku includes not only earphones for it's remote but an HDMI Cable.4. Amazon Prime Video streaming. I guess greedy Apple does not want competition playing over their device. Too bad Apple tries to charge for everything I can only surmise that the only reason Netflix is available through it is that they knew they had nothing to offer without it.Overall worth purchasing.",

Being a huge fan of Amazon, I dumped Netflix and bought Apple TV hoping to stream Amazon Prime videos to my HDTV through Apple TV (Herein lies the disappointment). Like all other apple products it is a beautiful product with inherent simplicity but it looses big time by not having an Amazon App or interent browser capabilities that I have seen. Maybe Apple designed it this way so that you would be influenced to buy an iPad for the mirroring capabilities. I don't know if Amazon can get Apple to get in line with this Apple TV snafu but I sure hope something resolves. For now I have a $99 swell looking device that neither connects to Hulu nor Amazon Prime but will play iTunes across my TV speakers. Whooptie Doo! Can I get a refund?

You can't just turn on Apple TV and watch a movie or tv episode you've purchased outside of Apple TV. Any purchases you make ON and THROUGH Apple TV, you can watch without having a computer on, however.WHEN COMPARED TO ROKU -- Apple TV fails when compared to Amazon VOD, for example. On Amazon, whether you purchase on your PC or through the VOD channel on Roku, you can watch your content without a computer. Your library shows up on the Amazon VOD channel on Roku. No need to power on your PC or Mac then stream it to Roku.#2 - You CANNOT play iTunes U content WITHOUT first downloading it to your PC or mac/iphone/ipad, then converting it to a Podcast. What?! It's true. If you want to watch iTunes U content on your Apple TV, you first have to download it on your device, then change the video format. Then stream it, again.At this point you're wondering, what if i just turn on my PC or MAC, put in an HDMI cable and connect it to the tv? Hmm... should I pay $99 for that ability?

You would buy media on your computer, and send it to the Apple TV as you would your iPod, iPhone, or iPad (other devices with hard drives) but wirelessly via your home Wi-Fi network.  Now, the Apple TV streams.  There's just enough storage on the device to hold buffer data, but the concept is that it streams the data.  Which means, the computer has to be on, and iTunes has to be open.  I think.  At least, that's the only way it works for me.  If the Internet goes down (problem with the ISP, cable cut, bad storm, whatever), you will have a tough time watching anything via the Apple TV.With the original Apple TV, after sending media to the device, I could turn off the computer, disconnect from the Internet, and watch and listen to whatever resided on the Apple TV's hard drive.  It'd be nice if Apple could bring back the previous capabilities while retaining the current form-factor and other improvements of the current Apple TV.  For now, as long as the Internet is up, and my computer doesn't crash, it works great.",

    "reviewText": "I have had my apple tv since July/2010.  Here are the things I like-dislike about it:LIKE:- setup is easy- Video resolution is good(we are still on the 720p box)- the remote is built well and has been dropped a LOT without issues.- AirPlay is a nice feature- different options to play movies, I.E. from my computer, netflix etcDISLIKE:- apple movie rentals are TOO expensive.  A B movie from 1985 should not cost $4.99.  A good example is \"re-animator\".  Some use the excuse of \"well it's just convienent to rent from home blah blah\".  Say what you want, but the prices are TOO high and keep customers like myself from renting.  Here is a tip to apple:  If you rent movies at .99 cents(older movies) and I rent 5 a week, that's $4.95.  Now if you keep the prices of those same movies at $4.99 EACH, I personally will not rent anything.  I am also betting a LOT of other customers don't rent because of the same issue.  So you either keep prices the way they are and get ZERO or lower them and get more rentals.  Why would I \"buy\" a movie on there?  Its not a tangible object like real blueray or DVDs.- Netflix - even though it's a separate company, they are attached in apple tv.  I spent over 3 months last year trying to resolve a buffering issue with them.  My cable company pointed the finger at Netflix and vice versa.  Some changes were finally made(they never told me what) and it got better.  BUT..... If I play Netflix from my iPad or Mac, I never get buffer issues.  This lead me to believe the apple tv was giving problems.-  HDCP error -  boy this is annoying.  You go to watch a movie and 4 seconds later it freezes.  A minute later the infamous \"HDCP\" error pops up which makes you reboot apple tv.  I have followed all the suggestions to resolve the issue and still get this error about 2-3 times a week.- TV shows on apple tv - $2.99 a episode?  Yep you read that right, they are $2.99 for ONE 47 minute episode.  I cancelled my cable tv in June 2011 and got a antenna. Now I get 24 HD channels for free.  I don't get discovery channel, or AMC but the savings alone make up for it(was paying $165 a month for cable & Internet), now it's down to $60).- I tunes festival - I'm not sure how that option showed up because it just appeared one day without updates.  Kinda boring.- Hulu plus -  if you have a Netflix subscription, don't bother with Hulu.  Netflix(dare I say it) has a better selection.  We tried Hulu for 4 days and most of the selections were boring or not worth watching.  There was also a HUGE selection of Korean movies.  I personally don't speak Korean, so they are worthless to me.- YouTube is what it is.... Plays videos from YT.- the other options are really boring unless your into basketball or hockey.  And even then, you have to have subscriptions to both.  Can we say nickel and diming here......With the way companies break everything up and \"give you more options\" these days, what it really means is \"we are going to charge everything we can for EACH item\".  Again, see my \"nickel and diming\" comment above.My wife and I are currently looking for a Internet ready TV so we can get rid of the apple TV box.  It's quite sad because we moved ALL of our computers(4 total) from PC to Mac in mid 2010.  Being really happy with the move, we figured apple tv would be awesome.  Needless to say, it's mediocre at best.And don't get me started on the horrible podcast or radio options.......  One word for them:  CRAP!!!!",

Apple tech support says that Apple TV won't work with a captive network, and that I should buy a router and set up my own wireless network in the room--the school, however, won't allow me to do this. Come on, Apple! You had to know that this would be problem! Apple TV should come with a big black-box warning that it may not work in dorm rooms! How about a little truth in advertising!

This TV is HDCP compliant (according to the TVs manual) but I could not get any video out signal from the AppleTV.I tried 3 different HDMI cables, in the 3 different HDMI ports on the TV in various combinations and it would not detect a video out signal from the ATV. Audio however, worked (using optical audio out).I have read various forums saying AppleTV3 will not product a video out signal if the TV is non-HDCP compliant but this model is. I have heard people reporting similar issues after updating to the newATV firmware. Ive since returned this unit for a refund and will go with a Roku3.

Well, you can't on Apple TV. Do you watch cable shows on Xfinity? Can't do that on Apple TV. What about HBO GO? Nope! All you get for streaming is Netflix, other then Hulu which is crap. I am not even able to use Air Play and watch these apps on my iPad through Apple TV. What's the point of a set top box without useable apps? What's the point of Air Play if I cannot watch these apps that are on my Ipad? I have the first generation Roku and it is far more capable then this thing. If you own or have ever used a Roku then don't even think about this device. Apple needs to open up the source code on this and let people create apps for it. Some of the previous mentioned apps are an issue with them and Apple not seeing eye to eye, but as the customer that is not my problem.",

At first startup, or if the Apple TV ever gets unplugged or there is a power failure, the Apple TV goes into an endless loop trying to set the date and time.  After searching the web, I learned that you need to use a secondary wifi source, such as your cell phone's hotspot, to connect to the Apple TV - this fixes the problem, and you can then go back and connect using your wireless router.Each time you have to reconnect to your router in this fashion, you then have to re-enter your router's password using the klunky Apple TV user interface.  Then you can finally use your Apple TV again.Until this odious bug is fixed, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",

    "reviewText": "I recently purchase an Apple TV, and I must say I am horribly disappointed by the experience.  This product absolutely does not live up to Apple standards.This feedback has been prompted by an increasingly frustrating series of experiences with my Apple TV.First, I was quite surprised to learn that I can not rent a movie on my computer and then stream it to my Apple TV.  I must rent it on my Apple TV or on my Mac.  This is just silly...I can stream a movie that I own from my computer to my Apple TV (a movie which is physically sitting on my computer and then streamed to my Apple TV) - BUT I can not stream a rented movie from my computer to my Apple TV (a movie that is, incidentally, ALSO physically sitting on my computer).  But I was willing to overlook this flaw...Next I was disappointed in what seems to me to be a rather clumsy interface.  It looks great, but I just found that several menu options were not in intuitive locations.  I was also willing to overlook this though.Next...I was disappointed in the performance of the iTunes photo streaming...I could not get the Apple TV to stream my entire library, apparently due to the size, yet I found no readily available guidance on how many photos I can expect the Apple TV to stream reliably.  It works as long as I select a limited number of events from my photo library.  Ok, a minor annoyance, but again I was willing to overlook this.But this next issue was the straw that broke the camel's back...I had several friends over to watch War Horse on Friday night (which I had to re-rent on the Apple TV once I discovered that I could not rent on my mac and subsequently transfer or stream it to the Apple TV).  I click play, excited to watch my first rental on the Apple TV.  I'm surprised to see it will take 1 hour and 40 minutes before we can watch the movie.  Dismissing it as an inaccurate estimate of the remaining time, I am hopeful after the estimated time fairly quickly drops to 36 minutes...still disappointing, but acceptable.So we switch my TV input to DVD and watch a short home video for about 25 minutes (while the Apple TV keeps downloading).  When we switch back to the Apple TV, it STILL says it will take 36 minutes, and then it jumps up to 51 minutes.  At this point, I unplug the Apple TV, switch to the free Amazon App that is in my Panasonic TV, and within 5 minutes we are watching the movie.  You can't blame it on network issues, since Amazon was able to stream it without a problem in less than 5 minutes under the same network conditions.This experience renders the Apple TV almost completely useless.  It is now reduced to a nice screen saver that shows SOME of my pictures, and a way to share my iPad screen without connecting a wire.  I'll be returning it, since $100 is too much to pay in my book for a snazzy screen saver and to save a cable connection.I hope Apple rectifies these issues at some point in the near future.  I really wanted to like this product.",

Amazon dropped Apple to $92. So even better now.Apple streams most things through iTunesI got rid of my wires,/connections to my receiver for audio/video, now stream my musin through itunes. Sounds great.(Some of the wires I had, had noise introduced on them, from the laptop power supply, and I had this same problem on mac and PC.Movies too, I stream through Apple TV.Why 4 stars?Network connection - the Apple TV often drops the wifi connection and then comes back. Since my laptops never drop connection, the problem is with the apple tv box, not with my wifi.Other users have complained, and I can confirm too, that when the connection drops/comes back, several times, my laptops/iphones cannot detect the apple tv. Then you have to do all sorts of workaroundsa) Turn the wifi off/on on phone/laptop. This works most of the time.b) Restart either the apple tv or your phone/laptopMany movies do not work through iTunes, so I need to stream using Xbox/Media center PC/ Windows Media Player.

My TV is a 62\", rear-projection, DLP with a fantastic HD picture and HDMI inputs (Toshiba 62HMX84), but WHAT my TV is really doesn't matter.  What does matter is when it was manufactured.  When some of my content wouldn't play with an error about HDCP, I did some digging and found that in 2004, the HDCP standards (copy protection for HD shows/movies) were put in place (my TV is HD, but not HDCP compliant).When you use your AppleTV to play Netflix, Movie Previews, HD movies or TV you purchased from iTunes, they all require HDCP or you will get an error message on your screen and cannot watch them.  If you search for an answer, a lot of people will tell you to power off and power on both the AppleTV (or other HDMI device) and the TV...and this will work for some people, but if your TV is a little older, it may not be compatible at all.I didn't know I had this issue for a long time because my HD TiVO has component outputs that go to the TV (instead of HDMI) and Netflix will play fine HD from the TiVO, but this AppleTV has ONLY HDMI.I love the AppleTV and I'm going to keep it, but I can only play movies that are standard definition from iTunes, home-made movies or that I have ripped from DVD (removes copy protection as part of the process).  I will have to wait until I upgrade my TV to enjoy most of the other features of the AppleTV (renting movies from iTunes, Netflix, Previews, etc).  If you have nothing but time on your hands, I've also read that you can remove the protection from iTunes downloaded HD material, but you still can't get around the streaming content like Netflix or iTunes movie rental.",

Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version. The only way to get apps and more streaming services on your apple tv 3 is to use air play with either an iPad , iPhone or iPod touch. At this point there is no jailbreak available on the apple tv 3. I didn't notice a difference in performance on the newer apple tv 3. Also I personally didn't notice a difference in picture quality between my apple tv 2 and 3. If you already have an apple tv 2 then I don't think you need to upgrade to the newer one. Also if you are considering an apple tv at this time and don't have tv that is 46 inches or larger I would strongly recommend looking at getting a refurbished apple tv 2 for $69 directly from appple. I decided the return my apple tv 3 and just get the refurbished older model. It's cheaper, easier to jailbreak and still has the great features and interface.I still find the aplle tv 3 overpriced when compared to other streaming devices that it competes with. But for the air play functionality alone it makes a great accessory for the iPad , iPhone and iPod touch. Also the netlix interface is far suporior to any other device I've tried.",

The remote is a beautiful machined work of art. It fits nicely in the hand and the simple concept should be a lesson to any company that makes remotes.Setup: Could not be simpler.  Plugged it in to TV and within 5 minutes was logging in to Netflix and streaming video.  Most difficult part was remembering passwords to do one-time logins.Use:1. The UI is simple, elegant and easy to use.2. The video quality is excellent, it does not downgrade quality.  Streaming Netflix on my TV or through XBox always was frustrating in regards to video constantly coming in at different resolutions.  Used to blame it on my Internet connection until seeing the difference on Apple TV.3. iTunes integration is really nice and easy to set up.  No complicated directions to follow, Apple TV walks you through in an easy to follow manner.4. Never crashes.  The smart TV functions on my Samsung TV crashed or froze so frequently that I figured it was just part of using it... And it was, but not with Apple TV.  In almost a year of using it, it has not crashed or needed to be reset one single time.5. If you have an iPad, iPhone or Mac computer Airplay is great.  You can easily mirror the device onto your T.V. to show slideshows, presentations or anything you can think of.6. Can run slide shows from either Photostream or FlickerA couple of months ago my cable bill went through the roof after discounts expired.  Total bill was coming to over 200 dollars a month and best they could do was to reduce it to 120.  This was without any premium channels.  After doing a little math I concluded I could pay for Netflix and Hulu plus as well as buy the TV shows not available on either of those services on iTunes and still pay much less per month.Only drawback for me is no Amazon content available.  Maybe in the future...After two years of use and two years of having no cable I am more than happy with my choice of cutting cable and going this route. Over all the savings alone have more than paid for the Apple TV box. Since the time I wrote the review several apps have been added and content has increased to the point I just do not see going back to cable at all. Recently when I was presented with a chance to get video service with my internet for just $3 more I declined. What is the point of having a bulky cable box when I can watch the latest programs on Hulu plus when I want? In addition there is now even streaming news as well as a greater variety of services offered.Do yourself a favor and ditch cable video for either Apple TV or one of the competitors. You will save money, be able to watch what you want when you want to watch it.",

    "reviewText": "Here's the scoop:My reason for buying: 1.  I've been trying to find a way to get rid of my cable bill but I'm not willing to say goodbye to certain tv shows. 2. I'm an &#34;Apple&#34; person. I have an iPhone and iPad and soon to have a Mac laptop. I chose Apple TV over the other gadget alternatives due to the fact I can &#34;mirror&#34; my other gadgets. The biggest reason for me is I downloaded all the tv network apps that my shows are on. I can watch my shows free through those apps (even the newest episodes if you watch within a week of them first airing). It has tons of other perks too! HBO! All the shows and movies free and on your own time. Lots of other apps for shows and movies and music (including sports) You can bring up all your photos etc..... Literally anything u can do with your other Apple gadgets (Aside from making phone calls I assume).What you need to know:an HDMI cable is not included so you need to buy one if you don't have an extra. They're only a few dollars on amazon. If u don't have wireless internet you'll also need an Ethernet cable. And optional is an audio optical cable if u want it. But I don't need it apparently becaus mine is working perfectly without it.Lastly, I had issues figuring out how to enable &#34;home sharing&#34; and &#34;airplay mirror&#34;. You have to turn on home sharing from a Mac or PC through iTunes. It can't be done from iPad, iPhone or Apple TV. I just downloaded iTunes for my PC and turned it on though there. For turning on &#34;mirror&#34; you go to the home screen of your iPhone or iPad and swipe up from the bottom. When the menu slides up click &#34;airplay&#34; and &#34;Apple TV&#34; and switch to &#34;yes&#34; and it'll pop up on your tv screen (when you have your Apple TV screen on).I highly recommend it to do away with a high cable bill. Nowadays you can watch your shows free through apps and since this allows you to bring them up on your tv it's perfect. And watch it when you want without paying for DVR service. I hear amazon fire is pretty cool and I don't doubt it one bit. But if you have Apple products already I say this is a must to link them all together.",

    "reviewText": "I have twoRoku HD Streaming Playerdevices streaming Netflix, HuluPlus, and Amazon Instant Video in my household.  Why get an Apple TV?  Apple iPad integration, iTunes library access on my HDTV, and a need for speed!Side by side the Apple TV device blows my Roku away in terms of grabbing streaming content, buffering it, and getting it to play.  I love that!  Apple TV also offers up the cool features of syncing with my iTunes library and AirPlay with my iPad.  I love that too!What I don't love about the Apple TV is that it doesn't support Amazon Instant Video.  Maybe with future upgrades or generations it will, but for now, this newest version doesn't and that gives the advantage to Roku in terms of programming options.Roku also offers a bunch more 'channels' to surf than Apple TV, but Apple TV's ability to stream podcasts from iTunes evens things out for me.If you have HBO, you can use the AirPlay function to stream HBO content via the Apple TV to your HDTV.  AirPlay also allows iPad users to mirror what they are doing on their iPad to an HDTV with Apple TV connected to it.Apple TV gives you options like a plethora of Internet radio stations to listen to, FLICKR, and sports subscription channels.The downside to Apple TV is the price, but despite that, I'm glad I spent nearly double what I paid for my Roku on this device.  It's sleek interface runs smoothly (update it when you hook it up so you have the latest firmware) and quickly, and Netflix, HuluPlus and YouTube look great when played on the Apple TV.With AirPlay (super cool way to stream video from your iPad to your TV) and a free iTunes app called 'Remote', you can play your downloaded movies and TV programs from iTunes via the Apple TV.If you don't have an iTunes account, music library or iPad, you may want to stick with Roku with the bonus of a lower price and Amazon Instant Video.Apple TV is great except for its lack of Amazon syncing and limited channel add-ons.  Despite those faults (and the reason for the 4 out of 5 rating), it's really a fantastic piece of hardware with impressive speed and Apple product integration, making it worth a purchase in my book.7/1/13 - UPDATE:Be sure to do the software update to this device when prompted, or check in settings for the update.  This latest update seems to have helped the speediness of the transitions and optimized the Apple TV.  A slight update to the visual interface is nice too.  Unfortunately, Amazon Instant Video is not yet part of the update.",

    "reviewText": "My husband and I decided to cancel our cable/satellite and move to strictly stream our programming from the internet and Netflix. I opted for Apple TV instead of subscribing to something like Hulu Plus. There are, of course, pros and cons to both options. For me it boiled down to not wanting another monthly subscription so I am sacrificing on some content.Regarding my experience with Apple TV thus far...installation was extremely simple! I was up and running within 10 minutes. The first thing I did was bring up one of my major network apps on my iPad (abc/cbs/nbc) and using Airplay and the mirroring technology stream an episode of one of my favorite shows. Worked like a charm! (I did have to Google the steps on this because it wasn't listed in the manual how to set up Airplay, but it was very simple).  This was one of my main reasons for buying Apple TV, so I could stop watching my current seasons of shows on small screens like my iPad and iPhone (or computer). The picture was crystal clear and once it had a solid connection, it played flawlessly (a few hiccups at the start).After that, I brought up Netflix. This was just an added bonus for me that Netflix streaming was included, I already had this capability through my Samsung BluRay player and my Wii. But let me tell you, the Netflix experience using the Apple TV is stellar compared to the Wii and BluRay player! It connects extremely quickly, much quicker than my BluRay player and the look and feel is just outstanding.There are a lot of apps already available with Apple TV but be forewarned, you need a programming subscription with a major provider for a lot of the content. I knew this going in, so this didn't disappoint me. But there is still a lot that you can leverage: PBS, The Weather Channel, Radio, YouTube and more. Let alone anything in your iTunes.The one con is that iTunes rentals and purchases for movies, TV shows/series, etc. is pretty inflated, at least for my area of the country. Between RedBox, Netflix and brick & mortar rental stores, you can rent shows for much less than iTunes offers. The convenience is nice however, if that is worth the inflation to you.Some features I recently learned about but have not used yet: there is a special connection with Yahoo that you can use. I want to explore this more. You can also use your iDevice as a remote by downloading the Apple TV Remote app. I downloaded the app but haven't used this yet. The remote it comes with is nice and simple, but very small so downloading the app is a good back-up plan in the event the remote gets lost (I have a 4 & 5 year old!).I'm looking forward to the updates that Apple makes to Apple TV because as awesome as it is now, I know it is only going to get better. And for $99, your ROI will be quick if your eliminating a cable/satellite subscription like me.",

Ironically, at home, it was my kids who convinced me to go Apple. We now have Iphones, Ipads, Ipods, Imacs ... and now the Apple TV.  Like all of those products named above, it is simple, well designed and full of features. As most of the reviewers have noted, if you are tied to the Apple world, the TV is an essential part. I also signed up for iMatch in which I have uploaded all of my CD's and \"legalized (or matched) all of my Napster-downloaded songs (most of which I had in one media form or another anyway). iMatch is a beautiful solution to the problem of where to organize all of your media, and the Apple TV makes your TV a view to the cloud.

That it can stream from other sources is nice but I already have lots of devices that can do it as well... well, it turns out not &#34;as well&#34;, but &#34;too&#34; More on that later.Setup was laughably easy.  I plugged it in, turned it on, waited less than a minute, and it displayed a message on the screen that I should tap it with my iPhone.  I wasn't sure why but I always do what technology tells me to so tap I did.  Apparently there is some magic where the tap transferrs details about my home network because a few seconds later the Apple TV was connected to my home wireless system!  No remembering WEP names or WPA2 keys or even if I'm using WEP or WPA.  Just a tap and I was done!  (BTW, *nobody* should be using WEP as just about anyone can crack in in less than a day.)Sending my iPad screen to the projector just started to work.  I select Airplay on the home screen and whatever is on my screen is also on my... screen.  I couldn't ask for more.As for the stuff it does that is the &#34;same&#34; as Roku and every DVD player and video game made in the past several years; this provides the clearest, most responsive, and user frientliest interface I've seen.  Too bad it doesn't stream Amazon content.  &#34;Why can't we all just get along?&#34;Because of the way Amazon reviews are displayed I doubt anyone will get a chance to see this before it gets buried under a ton more of what I expect will be equally glowing praises.  If you do find it helpful I hope you will fine a way to let me and Amazon know.

I personally have an Apple Eco-system at home, so it makes sense to use this in my case. The device is great if you use streaming services such as Netflix or Hulu. The user interface on the ATV is dead simple to use and the configuration is super easy, you will be up and running in under 5 minutes. You can also run YouTube and stream radio stations from around the world, and with the latest update, can run HBOGo. The one drawback of this device, is the streaming of personal media. It will only stream video from your iTunes library, as long as the ATV and your iTunes library are on the same network. iTunes videos are in m4v, or mp4 format only. If your videos are saved in any other format, they will not be playable on the ATV, unless you run them through a video converter. I worked mainly with .avi and wmv files, before  I got this device, I had to re-encode my whole video library to mp4 format. While it was time consuming to do this, (over 100+ videos), It was well worth it, as the file sizes for my HD-WMV files, shrunk from 8GB down to 2.5GB with no loss in quality. There are a lot of applications out there that can do this conversion. (For a free method, I'd suggest Handbrake, as it's super easy to use, and is available on MAC, PC and Linux) Another nice feature of the ATV is iTunes Match. If you currently subscribe to this service, $24\\year through iTunes, all the music in your iTunes library will be available on the ATV without needing to have your PC on. Another plus, comes if you run an Apple computer, or have an iPhone. The ATV has the ability to &#34;mirror&#34; those devices. I have an 11&#34; Macbook Air, but I can wirelessly sync it directly to my TV, using the ATV. So instead of an 11&#34; screen, I have a 47&#34; monitor. Same goes for the iPhone, your TV will now be the screen, which is great for playing games. I highly recommend this device to anyone who uses Apple products, you won't be disappointed. If your a PC user, you can still use it, but using something with a bit more support for different formats, like a Roku might be better suited for you.",

So far I'm impressed with the overall quality of what you can get through this tiny device.For one thing, 1080p content seems to be somewhat less compressed than other solutions I've seen. Given adequate bandwidth, and the same 1080p title looks better on the Apple TV than it does on some other services. Many people don't realize that 1080p alone isn't really a guarantee of any particular quality...just as important is the degree of compression applied to the video data. Broadcast quality 1080p often comes out of the camera at 60mb/sec. The best Blu-ray DVDs are about 40mb/sec...even top-end consumer video cameras are in the 24mb/sec range. Apple TV is 8mb/sec, but most of the competing products are maybe half this, meaning that while the Apple is tough on bandwidth, it gives you a better looking picture. To me, this alone is worth the price of the unit.Speaking of bandwidth, I find I just can't get adequate performance on wireless, so I've generally preferred to connect the Apple TV directly to my router with an Ethernet cable. A little less convenient, but overall much more stable. Of course, I use wireless from my computers to the Apple TV, but for online content, the wired approach gives me a much better experience (I have 35mbps Verizon FiOS).The other thing I love about the Apple TV is the included Airplay. My iPad2 not only streams music and videos, I can mirror my desktop to the Apple TV and project my iPad's desktop onto the big screen. As others mentioned, this feature is coming to Mac OS X in an upcoming release and will be a very handy way to display Mac content on the big screen. It seems to work quite well wirelessly, with just a slight delay.Overall, this little device is definitely worth the investment if you have adequate network capacity.",

If your TV is the focal point of your home entertainment as it is for me, and you're a Mac, iTunes, or iPad user, then this device is awesome. It allows you to play anything you have ever bought or downloaded from iTunes (music, movies, shows, podcasts, etc.) on your TV instantly and wirelessly. If you connect Home Sharing from a computer running iTunes (a PC in my case), you can watch or listen to anything in your iTunes library, regardless of whether you purchased it from iTunes (e.g. ripped CDs or DVDs). But the best part for me was that you can mirror your iPad or other iOS device onto the TV through the built-in Airplay feature. For example, you can listen to Sirius or Pandora through the TV and control it from the iPad wirelessly. Apple TV also has built-in apps for Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and a few other services if you're so inclined.  The $100 price tag is not bad considering the capability it gives you. There is nothing else like it available for mirroring iOS devices onto a TV. The main reason I debated was that I can already stream Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu directly onto my TV without having to by a separate device (I have an LG smart TV).  But all of my music is in iTunes and there is no way to play it on the TV otherwise.  But the thing that really sold me was the iOS device mirroring.  Bottom line- I highly recommend it.",

Well if you have a Roku and no iTunes then go buy a Roku, if you have an iTunes account well you better stick around. Oh and how about that Chromecast dongle that only works half the time and destroyed their only reason to being relevant? So yes, this ATV3 is not jailbreak compatible but that's okay. Most consumers don't understand that anyways. So here are the reasons why you should buy it.1) iTunes Library2) Airplay3) Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu+Do you have your iTunes library full of movies and music or what not? Try using Home Sharing and boom your entire library is on your AppleTV (given your computer is on). I love this because I have over 100 HD .mp4 movies on my 2TB hard drive connected to my mac which is in my bedroom while I have Apple TV's in my bedroom as well as my living room (projector). So now I have the greatest inexpensive home theater setup.What in the world is Airplay?So whenever someone comes over my apartment and they have an iDevice I like to mess with them and borrow their phone. Then I ask oh what's your favorite song? They tell me then I Airplay it to my setup. Most people are pretty impressed by it or shocked by it.

I really enjoy the PBS app for watching programs like Nova.  Also, the Airplay is very nice to have to stream music, and mirror my iPad for Amazon Prime videos.  I hope everybody will play nice at some point and Apple will include the Amazon app at some point, or Amazon allowing an app to be used.I can attest to the wireless functionality being very good.  I live in remote Alaska - no roads in or out where I live - and there is no broadband.  My internet is all done by satellite, so you can imagine the speeds.  I usually get around .512 - .520gbps.  If you don't understand the technical reference - think dial-up on a good day.So, that said, I still can stream Netflix without interruption, and the Apple TV can do it all wirelessly.

I found myself doing a side by side comparison of the two products and here are my findings.AppleTVPros: Works out of the box, minimum effort to setup, really easy to use interface + wifi. Can Restream old purchased episodes. Netflix App much cleaner and more superb. Streaming and buffering causes no delays or degradation of picture. AirPlay makes up for a lot of the limited channels (with Mountain Lion the functionality goes up even more). iPad Remote easy to useCons: Limited Channels...needs an open API like Roku to build more channelsRoku2 XSPros: Many Channels available, Cheaper ($10), Free Movie Channels like Crackle, AmazonPrime availability, Vendor neutral. iPad Remote easy to useCons: Missing iTunes integration, Poor quality and buffering (constant downgrading the image quality on NBA League Pass and Netflix). User UI is just bland and could be cleaner. Bugs and issues. Most channels you have to pay extra for. Roku disconnects from my wifi network randomly whereas the AppleTV never does during side by side streaming. Setup takes longer and more tweaking needed by the user.Summary:While the Roku offers you many more channels the end user experience on the AppleTV makes it much more simple to utilize. If you have some form of Apple Eco System then the AppleTV is for you. If you hate Apple then the Roku is for you. Each product has their own advantages and disadvantages. For me in the end it was about the user experience and ease of using the player and the AppleTV edged out. It's not to say I won't be using my Roku but until there are some updates to fix some of the buffers and issues the AppleTV is by far the better product.UPDATE: Completely Dropped my Roku in favor of Apple TV now. For some of the comments below I have a 30 Mbps down, 10 Mbps Up and being a network engineer and having quite an impressive armada of enterprise switches in the house I know it's not the network but the Roku. It's either the memory or the application code that keeps causing issues itself. Also for those that claim they cannot view movies due to apple protections...download airparrot and VLC. It works perfectly.",

    "reviewText": "When Amazon released the Fire TV I rushed to buy one. I've plenty of Amazon hosted content and the prospect of a set top box which was both faster than my 3rd generation Apple TV and allowed for games made it seem like as great deal. So I did buy one, in fact, I bought two as I saw the opportunity for writing software for the big screen. But after a few weeks of novelty, my kids and I have reverted to using the Apple TV, although I will still switch over to the Fire TV now and then.The Fire TV is noticeably peppier given the newer processor in it. But this really only shows up in things that the Apple TV doesn't do, namely playing games. The more games I played on the Fire TV, the more I realize that Apple will have to release a 4th generation Apple TV with a dual core A7 and a beefier GPU  should they want to compete in the light set top gaming market. This current model is not going to be a competitive gaming platform. And that's OK.When it comes to what it does do, the current Apple TV is plenty fast at navigating, and displaying content. It shows 1080p high quality very well. Better, in my opinion than the Fire TV.  And the unified 2 dimensional grid interface used by the video apps on the Apple TV is more efficient than the haphazard interfaces seen on the Fire. The Netflix app on the Apple TV is noticeably more polished  and surprisingly given the hardware differences, much smoother scrolling than the utilitarian standard Android version distributed in the Fire TV App Store.  Since much of what we use a set top box for is watching Netflix, the more pleasant experience wins.As for controllers, the Fire TV remote is fine, and speaking into the voice recognition microphone, for that content it supports, is much nicer than arrowing around an on screen keyboard. But two things, it doesn't work everywhere not YouTube and not Netflix, and I don't use my Apple TV's remote. I pair a small Bluetooth keyboard, the kind found in iPad Mini typing cases, with my AppleTV and use it as my primary controller. Nicer than the remote, nicer than the iPhone remote App, nicer than the Fire TV and its fancy Bluetooth remote. It rocks when searching, jumping around lists and most importantly entering passwords.So, with a keyboard and a smoother Netflix integration, my family gravitates back to the Apple TV. But it is purchased content that keeps us there. We have a fairly large amount of movies bought from iTunes (maybe 100) and a huge number of TV shows and I don't care to have two places where I keep this content. Yes, this is the dreaded lock in but even if I were choosing a lock in today, I'd still choose iTunes for my content. One, every weekday there are free TV episodes to snag, and they are free longer, so I can bulk up on interesting new shows before choosing seasons to buy. There are a few free TV episodes on Amazon but there are only a handful at one time. Two, I have Apple devices and they are easily provisioned with movies or shows for trips or just watching from bed.  Three, I tend to think there is more HD content and the HD quality tends to be better. Having said that, it is a great feature of the Fire TV that it supports the Dolby Master Audio format, and not just Dolby Digital. I appreciate that Apple arranged its rights contracts such that I didn't have to pay to upgrade HD content from 720p to 1080p.We do switch over to Fire TV for Prime video content and dabbling with games.I hope Apple opens up the next Apple TV to 3rd party apps. That's a huge advantage of the Fire TV.I also have a Mac, and the integration of the Apple TV with OS X 10.9 has been quite flexible, and useful in a business setting or just as a way to share content amongst friends and family.Airplay support is one of the great advantages of Apple TV. I mainly use it to send music or podcasts to my home theatre speakers, but I have used it for sending Amazon Prime content to the big screen. I've even integrated Airplay support into my own apps I write, so I have one app that sends antenna signal quality to the TV and I had other drawing apps that show everyone what the user has drawn. It's a great feature, that I only wish more app developers took advantage of.People often ask why an iPad doesn't have an HDMI port. The AppleTV is the iPad's HDMI port, and a better than wired one that allows you to maintain mobility while still projecting to the big screen.Energy efficiency is first rate, at around a Watt during playback and practically nothing when asleep.I had to set the device to require a password for purchasing content from iTunes, and to enter my password via the Remote app on my iPhone, as otherwise, my naughty children would have purchased every episode of Fairly Oddparents.  Keep an eye out for discount iTunes gift cards occasionally found online.As for the differences between the 2nd generation and 3rd generation models, they are identical both in appearance and except for the 1080p capability in functions. While the newer model has a faster processor, in practice, the interface is zippy fast on either with any slowness due to network problems. If you don't have a 1080p TV, there is no reason not to stick with the 2nd generation, and even if you do, you might not notice a difference.  Both have gigabit Ethernet ports, and I recommend using a wired connection to your router if it is at all feasible.Apple is expanding the services offered on the device by partnering with the NBA, Major League Baseball, the NHL, and adding subscription model content like Japanese programming from Crunchyroll or TV shows via Hulu (although I'm not enamored with Hulus ads+subscription model; I'd rather pay to not see an ad. The PBS app is particularly nice and I don't have to record evening PBS shows anymore; there's a huge library of Nova and other programs right there. However, It's getting a little cluttered in there and I'm glad it's easy to disable apps.Other services have been useful. As I don't have access to ESPN, I've occasionally used the NBA app to watch game highlights. And my son has had an inordinate amount of enjoyment watching Minecraft run throughs on the YouTube app. I've even enjoyed the Flickr app displaying searches.So, in general, as an iOS user with a fair amount of purchased content, I've been happy with this device. It's my go to device for most of my  streaming needs. Still, I hope Apple takes Amazon up on the challenge and releases a more advanced, fast enough for games model with Siri integration and 3rd party gaming.",

Why then has my Apple TV suddenly jumped out front?The answer is Mountain Lion a/k/a OSX 10.8.Mountain Lion has a feature called AirPlay mirroring which streams anything on your Mac to your Apple TV. Anything means anything-movies, documents, web sites. At 1080p the resolution is amazing. Your big screen LCD will suddenly become the biggest monitor in the world.

    "reviewText": "Ok, so I bought this at a Best Buy a couple of weeks ago and it is a great addition to my apple inventory. I use both, Apple and Android so I don't like one over the other. Now for the main review on the Apple TV...I will separate this review into sections for your convenience...==== Air Play ====Personally, this was the main reason why I bought the Apple TV. I own two iPod Touches and an iPad and I use the Air Play on the Apple TV a lot. I can easily steam over to the Apple TV without any problems and it is really easy to do. I end up mirroring Youtube videos onto my TV Instead of watching them on the small screen. This is probably one of the best things about the Apple TV. If you don't have other Apple Devices and are just looking for a media box to stream netflix, huluplus, etc on your TV I would recommend buying a different product instead as they tend to have more features to them then the Apple TV.==== 1080P Content ====When renting or buying movies in the iTunes Store you can watch everything in 1080P! That is Full HD! You can also watch previously owned movies on your Apple TV so you don't buy them over again you just start enjoying on your TV Instead of an iPod/iPhone/iPad screen.==== Content/Channels ====The main downside to an Apple TV is the amount of content/channels it supports. It doesn't have as many channels as other media players like the Sony SMP-N200. If you want something cheaper, but with more channels and don't plan on using AirPlay then I would go with other options; however, if you do own other Apple Devices that are capable of AirPlay then this is a Great Buy! You can now have everything that is shown on your iDevice's screen on the screen of your TV! That is what makes the Apple TV such a popular product.Overall This is a great product that I really enjoy using and it adds to a great addition to my other Apple devices. I wish it would have more channels/content, but it does balance out since the Apple TV has AirPlay. I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!",

I was paying $90 a month for what was basically HD basic cable with a few extra channels thrown in, in one room with a DVR and now I'll never need to go back.My job has me working both day and evening hours, so I basically only watched the news, the Red Sox, and The Walking Dead. I decided it was just not worth spending close to $100 a month for the few things I watched. A also pay for Netflix and Hulu+ on top of that.With the AppleTV I only pay for what I want to watch, a la carte style.What I can't watch on Netflix or Hulu I can pay for through the Apple TV and stream. While the AppleTV doesn't have a native Hulu app I can watch that on my PS3 or Xbox360, or if I want to show off, mirror the app from my iPad or iPhone 4S.Using the CNN app on my iPad I can watch the news live and mirrored wirelessly to the AppleTV. The only thing I'm missing is the Sox, which are blacked out on MLB.TV since I live close to Boston.",

    "reviewText": "We purchased this Apple TV to take advantage of airplay from the iPad.  We put the basic Roku in a guest room that isn't used very often in order to avoid monthly cable equipment cost.  We have not gotten to the point of completely cutting the cord since there are still a few cable channels we enjoy, plus we like to get our local news and weather.  Although the overall content available on Apple TV pales in comparison to Roku, airplay helps to make up for it since you can stream Amazon, Pandora and others from your iPad through Apple TV onto your HDTV.  Plus Apple TV contains YouTube which is currently only available on the Roku 3 model, although supposedly that may change in the near future.  If you are a Comcast customer, they allow HBO Go to be activated on Apple TV but not through Roku.  Neither device is better than the other, both have their own advantages and disadvantages.  But if you are hesitant to cut the cord, with either one of these devices you may be able to subscribe to a smaller cable package and save money.",

If you're content buying things from the iTunes store and streaming videos from its short list of approved partners, you will probably adore this device. I was really disappointed. And I will tell you why.The problem is that if you'd like to do ANYTHING else, no matter how standard it might be on similar devices, you are out of luck.Want to watch that Blu-Ray you ripped into Xvid/avi? Nope. An .mkv file... half the tvs and Blu-Ray players out today can do that. Not your ATV. It only plays H264 stuff ripped into its formats. How about that camera phone video you made of your kid? Hardly. Maybe you made that video in one of the short list of approved formats. I hope you have it on a Mac or a PC running bloated old iTunes, because your shared network folders mean nothing to ATV. What if I just put it on a thumb drive and plug it in? Sorry, no USB ports. So if you're on Linux or you just don't like iTunes, you're S.O.L. I'm told there are elaborate ways to convert files and funnel them over from iTunes, but when competing devices offer plug n' play, how is that not an annoying hassle?How about streaming stuff... Maybe you'll just watch Hulu. Nope. (EDIT: Hulu has been added.) Amazon Instant Video? Nope. Blockbuster On Demand? Nope. Maybe listen to Pandora? Nope. Spotify? Don't kid yourself. Even my phone can play stuff off a UPnP server. Can't Apple TV? Nope again. No device has every service, every file format, but the ATV only has the ones that don't interfere with their moneymaking efforts. You could try and jailbreak it to get it to be more flexible... but there isn't a working jailbreak for Apple TV 3.If you browse through other compact media players, you're going to find that things like mkv/xvid support, USB ports, Hulu, and Pandora aren't just available, they're increasingly standard. Half the Blu-Ray players coming out today can do much of this stuff, many of the tvs, too.But even though the iPhone offers similar functionality to competing phones, the iPad offers similar features to other tablets, and Apple laptops serve similar needs to PC laptops, the Apple TV isn't really analogous to other home media players at all. It lacks most of the functionality those devices have in common and exists primarily as an aesthetically pleasing way of expanding your existing relationship with Apple and its partners onto your television set. If this is all you need/want, consider this a four star review. But for me, looking for an all purpose media player, I felt really let down.If you want your media player to play YOUR media, your way or if you're interested in services that have any competing interest to the iTunes store, best look elsewhere. It's not that this is a bad device, it's just that it's not really a true peer to similar devices.As a post-script, please let me add that I'm not antagonistic to Apple products AT ALL. I have an iPad I adore. I also have a Windows desktop, an Android phone, and a Linux laptop. I'm just looking for the best stuff. I'm not pushing any OS-specific agenda. If you're an all-Apple-all-the-time person, you may love the Apple TV. But I wanted to offer my review for people who aren't.",

    "reviewText": "I first bought a Roku 2 XS from Costco then returned it for the Apple TV. The reason that I needed a device like this was to stream Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime for my wife and kids. We got rid of cable TV and decided to stick with over the air broadcast HD tv and internet streaming to save money. Here's why I decided to stick with the Apple TV.1. WiFi strength - My router is upstairs and my TV is downstairs.Roku 2 XS - it took about 4 or 5 attempts for the Roku to get setup under my wifi. First of all it could not see my 5ghz signal and for some reason it would go through the setup on my 2.4ghz signal, but end in an error. Finally, on the 4th or 5th attempt it went through.Apple TV - The setup was a breeze. It saw both my signals and the setup went through after the first attempt.2. Interface - I needed a VERY USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE. My wife is NOT tech savvy, but I consider myself above average when it comes to electronics.Roku 2 XS - The Roku's interface wasn't bad, but I didn't like how all of the channels were laid out in a single horizontal layout. You have to scroll sideways to view the channels. If you have a lot of channels installed, then it's a little troublesome to scroll to the end to go to the channel you want. You can list the channels in different order, but I like being able to view all the channels in a single screen. Once you click on a channel, the interface gets even worse for me. Netflix is a good example. The netflix interface is set up so that you see the suggestions for all of different genres of movies and shows on the main page. You have to scroll through a number of menus, which are hard to find, at first, to go to the recently viewed, instant queue, complete list of genres, search, and other sub menus. I wasn't as frustrated with it, but it took my wife so long to figure out some of the BASIC menus on the Roku box that she just ended up watching some shows on her 13\" laptop, instead. Happy wife, Happy life...Roku so far was not helping me.Apple TV - The channels are listed on one page with many more channels easily viewable at the same time on the TV screen. The interface just looked cleaner upon first glance. For some reason, it also seemed to scroll a lot smoother as I was scrolling through the channels. The Netflix channel was a LOT simpler to scroll through, as well. Once you click on the netflix channel, all of the different sub menus are listed on the right hand side of the interface. You can easily go to your instant queue, search screen, genre list, new arrivals, etc, without having to figure out where those menus are. My wife was able to find the kids shows, instantly. This made her happy.3. Channels - I was looking for a box for Netflix, Hulu, Movie purchases and rentals, and Amazon Prime.Roku 2 XS - Roku had all of them. I was pretty happy about that. The box that I bought from Costco also came with Angry Birds. That was a nice feature, although I only played it once and never had a desire to play it again. The Roku also had some other channels that the Apple TV does not have, like VUDU, Crackle, etc. I think the Roku is far superior to the Apple TV when it comes to the channel lineup. The main way to purchase/rent movies on the Roku is through Amazon. I like this because I actually like purchasing through Amazon rather than Apple. It seems like Amazon's prices are, generally, lower.Apple TV - Does not have Amazon Prime, and probably never will, but it does have Hulu and Netflix. I can't imagine that Apple would allow Amazon Prime to be a part of their Apple TV channel line up. Too bad. This was one of the things that really deterred me from buying it, initially. You can purchase/rent movies through Apple. I do believe Apple's prices tend to be higher, but I don't really purchase/rent movies for streaming, so it didn't matter to me that much.4. Streaming Quality - This was the real game changer for me.Roku 2 XS - I read that the quality of streaming on the Roku box was great. I'm sure the quality is great for those that have good wifi strenght or have the box connected via an Ethernet cable. I didn't have the luxury of having the box connected through a cable, because my router is too far for a physical connection. As soon as I started streaming a movie through netflix I was getting less than stellar quality. It also took about 20-30 seconds for every movie/show to get started. I figured it needed some buffering time. The movies were not coming through at HD quality and I was getting frustrated that I couldn't get the box to receive any movie at HD quality. Finally, I got one movie to start at HD quality, but in a few minutes it reverted back to a lower quality video. I'm sure this had to do with the wifi signal, but this was the main reason that I returned the box back to Costco.Apple TV - I thought that getting the Apple TV would not solve my issue with the bad wifi signal to the Roku box, so I was a little scared that I would have the same problem with the Apple TV. Once I started a movie on Netflix I saw a rotating, circular animation on the screen and I thought, \"GREAT, It's going to take forever to start.\" Wouldn't you know it, after about 5 seconds the movie started and it was perfect. The quality of the video was HD. I thought maybe it was because I was using my 5ghz signal, so I changed the wifi setting to my 2.4ghz signal and the video quality was perfect, again. I'm not sure why the Roku box didn't catch the wifi signal as well as the Apple TV, but I've not had problem, yet, with the Apple TV not being able catch a strong signal from my router.5. Playing local media through a computer/iPhone/iPad via box -Roku 2 XS - I can't really comment on this for the Roku box, because I didn't really try it. However, I do know that you can download software to your computer to stream movies from you computer to the Roku.Apple TV - I connected my iTunes to the Apple TV via homesharing, and voila it was done. The movie came out very nice. I did not consider Airplay as a reason to buy the Apple TV, but after I tried i fell in love with it. Airplay is NOT GOOD for watching movie through screen mirroring. The quality isn't that great, but it's not too bad watching it through homesharing via iTunes. I have all of my kids' DVD's ripped and in iTunes and it's a great way to view through the Apple TV on the TV screen. We also take a lot of pictures and video on our iPhones and we have been using Airplay to show the kids the videos that we take of them through the Apple TV. They love it and think it's great that they can view the videos on a big screen. There is one thing that took me a long time to figure out, though. When you try to view a video recorded through an iPhone via Airplay it will take FOREVER for the video to buffer. For 1 minute video it took about ten minutes to buffer. I figured out that you have to use \"Airplay Mirroring\" then view the video through the mirror mode and not through direct Airplay. I hope that makes sense. If you go through this route the video plays instantly without any buffering.Full Disclosure: I am what people might consider an Apple \"Fanboy\", BUT I first bought the Roku box, because I thought having more available channels and a cheaper price through Costco would be worth it. However, the Apple TV won out in the end because it was easier to use, the interface was better, and the quality of the videos were better through the way that I had it set up.If I had the ability to set up the box through a wired ethernet connection, then the results might have been different and I might have stuck with the Roku 2 XS. Despite a slightly higher price and not being able to access Amazon Prime, I'm happy with the Apple TV.",

    "reviewText": "I have a SmartTV, so adding Apple TV was a bit superfluous. Nevertheless, there are several features that made the purchase worthwhile for me.  To begin with, the whole family has a wide range of Apple devices, from iPod to iPhone to iPad, and the main feature I was interested in was Airplay.  Using Airplay, you can take whatever is on your screen and mirror it to the TV (this only works with the iPhone4S and later items, so the iPhone 4 and the iPod were left out).  You can also send the sound from your iOS device to your TV and from there to the surround sound system using Airplay.  Some games are designed for Airplay use as well.  Sky Gamblers is a good example of this.  You see the main view on the TV, and you have the secondary view, in this case your radar, on your phone.  There is a bit of lag from time to time, but you can get used to it.  Likewise, you can use Airplay to show photos and videos from your iOS device.  Unfortunately, in order to prevent &#8220;buffering&#8221; issues while playing back, Apple TV buffers much of the video beforehand, which means a long wait from when you press play to when you see video playing.Apple TV offers many other features, but I find that I rarely use them.  It is connected into iTunes, so your iTunes content is available to you, but other than that, I find most of the features are already present on my SmartTV.  For example, while Apple TV has Netflix, and a very nice interface at that, my TV has a Netflix button that has me in Netflix very quickly.  Other things like NHL Game Center are also available, but again, easier on my SmartTV.Apple TV is missing some things that you may expect from a SmartTV add-in box (like Roku).  There is no Pandora, Slacker, etc.  On the other hand, it can play anything from your iPhone, so you can just fire up Slacker from there instead.  Also, the remote is terrible.  Tiny, oversensitive, just not very good.  Fortunately, you can download the Remote app from the App Store (free) and control your Apple TV from your iOS device instead.  Another drawback, all it includes is the power cable.  You will need your own HDMI cable to attach it to your TV and you will need your own TOSLINK cable to connect it to your stereo (unless you use HDMI for that too).  Bad move on Apple&#8217;s part, since it won&#8217;t just work out of the box.  HDMI cables are cheap, and it would have been a good idea to include one, just to have people not have to go out to get one after they open the box and discover there isn&#8217;t one.Bottom line, Apple TV is great if you are already into the Apple Ecosystem.  If you have iPhones, pods, and pads, this is the gadget for you.  If you already have a SmartTV, then you already have most of the features here.  If you don&#8217;t have a SmartTV and are looking for an add-in to give you those functions, you may do better with a Roku or the like, but you won&#8217;t have the Apple functionality (Airplay and iTunes).",

I bought a Mac mini and use that in the living room as it can play Hulu desktop and Netflix in addition to my iTunes library and of course since its a full blown computer it can play movies and shows of almost any format. It can also stream pandora and I can show my photos on the big screen.I bought a roku player for my bedroom that sits next to my apple tv so I can play Hulu, netflix, pandora, and amazon instant streaming,and honestly I hardly ever touch the apple tv.The apple tv can be used to stream downloaded content from your iTunes library to your tv but it's a pain to get the content in apple tv format. With seasons of new shows ranging from 15-35 dollars on iTunes I would much rather pay 7.99 a month for unlimited access to Hulu plus. If I desperately need a show or movie I don't jump I buy via iTunes. It can often be found cheaper from a different source like Netflix or amazon streaming.If I could do it all over again I would only buy a Mac mini for the living room and a roku for the bedroom and call it good.***update**** Apple TV now has Hulu plus! It has now eliminated my need for my rocku player which is now set up in the guest bedroom! With the addition of Hulu plus, and it already being able to get Netflix this little box is just what I need! My only problem now is if I download a movie from my computer it has to be in correct format to play from Apple TV which can be time consuming at times to convert! Change my rating to four star!!!!!!  On a final note Apple TV has cool extras a good example beamy live streaming of the presidential debates by WSJ very cool and convenient.",

No pointing the remote up in the air as you browse.CONCLUSION!I had a ROKU - hated it. I had an XBOX, had a WII, tried plenty of streaming options.

Once you have it running you have access to a ton of programing and it comes in clearer than my cable signal! Here's the best part, I can stream Amazon Prime movies FREE using the \"Air Play\" feature on my iPad 2 and/or iPhone 4!!I was wondering if \"Air Play\" would work in this way and it does! Once you setup the Apple TV all of your mac devices will show you an \"Air Play\" icon in and obvious area of the application you are using. When you press the icon you will begin seeing what ever was on your device screen on your TV! Works perfect! The sound is great too, in stereo! I watched a movie last night streaming from my iPhone!! I think there is also supposed to be a \"mirror\" feature of Air Play that lets you see the image both on your device and your TV but apparently, it doesn't work on my older devices. So, what you see on your device is a black screen with a message that says \"Your movie is playing on Apple TV.\"One issue to beware of, in my understanding, is that the \"Air Play\" feature is not be available on computers that are older than mid 2011 except for iTunes. So, I have been streaming movies most of the time from my iPad. Not sure why Air Play will not work with older computers unless it is because I have not installed the latest OS X. I am running  OS X 10.8.5 and the AirPlay icon will not show up when I stream an Amazon Prime movie from either of my mid 2010 iMacs. I can however, get AirPlay to work though iTunes and can play anything in my iTunes library through Air Play from my mid 2010 iMacs.Of course you can also rent or even buy movies from iTunes also. It has Netflix and hulu too!When I first setup the apple TV, I had some problems getting it to play a movie without loosing the signal and then waiting for it to re-buffer again to begin playing. I found out that where I had my TV in relation to my wifi was causing it to receive a weak signal. I have my wifi coming from my Apple Time Capsule in the basement office of our home while the TV is up one floor. I checked the signal strength by using my laptop and placing it near the tv and going online and doing an internet speed test. I found that I was only getting about 3 mbps! Once I moved the Apple TV over to the other side of the TV stand and moved it forward about 6 inches the signal jumped up to 25 mbs! That solved the problem and we have since been watching movies every night!I have since installed an Apple Airport Express which can be used to boost your wifi signal from one area of your home to the next. It was super easy to setup and it simply joined my network on the Time Capsule when I plugged it in and asked me if I wanted to use it to expand my wifi network. Now I have a much stronger signal in the upper area of our home!If you have all Apple products like we do with 3 computers an iPad and Two iPhones, this is a must have! Just get it and enjoy!",

I'm a big fan of Pandora, so not being able to access it on the AppleTV is a pain.2. Amazon Instant Video: Same deal - Roku has it, AppleTV does not. And if you have prime, you want access to Instant Video.And, since these boxes are all about easy access to content, the lack of these hugely popular content providers is a really big issue for me. Plus, the benefits of the AppleTV over the Roku (airplay, access to your iTunes library) aren't that important to me. If they are to you, then your decision may be tougher.I say go with the Roku.**UPDATE**I have subtracted another star because I am encountering a very serious problem with my AppleTV now: whenever I try to buy a movie from iTunes, it takes HOURS (literally) of buffering before I can start watching.I have searched online and many people have this same issue, and nobody seems to have a solution. One website suggested switching to SD video quality, but even that hasn't helped. Why can I stream movies from Netflix or Amazon immediately, but it takes hours for an iTunes movie to buffer? It makes no sense. This obviously is yet another reason to buy a Roku instead. (In fact, last time I tried to rent from iTunes, it said it was going to take 1.5 hours before I could watch. I went downstairs and tried to rent from Amazon on the Roku LT, and I was watching it in less than 5 minutes.) Dumb. I'm selling my AppleTV and getting a second Roku!",

I have IPods, an iPad 2, a 2012 Mac Mini, and now Apple TV (newest version).  It's been well stated that there is not a lot available for content outside of the Apple Eco System as compared to Roku, for example.I've hardwired the ethernet connection to my router from the Apple TV, as suggested, to avoid overloading my wireless capability at home.I'm running the latest version of the OS on the Apple TV, Mirroring my Mountain Lion and Ipad screens is very handy.I've updated my review and added a 4th star because the 'wired ethernet causing content load failure' issue has been addressed.  The device needs to have more content available and have it available from the Itunes store.  That's the only drawback at this point that I see, and it costs 1 star...I have seen one 'bug' in the current version of the software.  Loading select Vimeo content caused an error message stating that the content wouldn't load because my TV didn't support the 'HDMC' protocol (an encryption protocol used by newer HDMI devices).  Recommended fix was replugging my Apple TV into the TV.  That didn't work.  Cold booting the Apple TV did fix the issue.As others have stated, this is a no brainer if you already have Apple products, especially newer ones.  If you don't have Apple products, then unfortunately at this time, I could not recommend this product to you, it simply wouldn't have the value per the cost to you... That's the bottom line.",

I decided to try the AppleTV as a solution to this problem and not only has it solved my problem, it provides what I have found to be the best source for additional video content - both TV and Movies.  The iTunes library has what I have found to be the largest and most current source for the content I either rent or choose to buy.  I also recently subscribed to iTunes Match and simply turned on that feature on the AppleTV and I am now enjoying higher quality versions of all the songs I own!The product is quite small and puts itself in a sleep mode when not in use so it does not generate a lot of heat in my system or take up much room.  The quality of the picture and sound is HD and the user interface is similar to navigating through an iPod or iPhone.  Your content is easy to find and access and content for rent or sale is easy to browse.There are also several third party 'apps' that grant access to their content (like NBA.com or Netflix) but I have not used them as they usually carry their own subscription and the iTunes content is more to my liking.I have heard the potential that Apple will allow developers access to AppleTV to begin to create apps for this device as well - this would only enhance what has provien to be a great solution to my entertainment problem.",

    "reviewText": "I'm a fan of many different Apple products, but I'm of the opinion that in recent years Apple has created one massively bad service (iTunes Match) and one not-so-functional product: the Apple TV 3.The 3rd Generation Apple TV should be great, and on first glance it appears to be. It can (under the right circumstances) play all your iTunes Match music, play Netflix/Vimeo/Hulu Plus/Youtube/iTunes videos, display your Photostream as a screensaver, and Airplay from your iPhone/iPad/iTunes PC/Mac.You'll notice that of the capabilities I listed above, many require some investment in the Apple infrastructure. I have that investment, with something like 8 Apple devices in my house from iPhones to a Mac Pro, and also have iCloud, iTunes Match, and a substantial iTunes library. Most of the function between Apple devices and the Apple TV works well. Unfortunately, the Apple TV's basic functions have serious issues.iTunes Match is the first major issue. I use both of them heavily. I already revealed my opinion of iTunes Match, which has been very difficult and problematic since I got it. If you set your Apple TV to stream iTunes Match music, it *will* freeze up every once in a while and stop playing until you tell it to start again. Very fast internet will not help you here, this is an Apple server problem. If you're running a PC or Mac with Homesharing enabled (and you should be) you can play your music from that, and it works like a charm. Of course, this requires you downloading the songs you want to hear ahead of time, which destroys the point of streaming.Photostream is a very cool feature that unfortunately doesn't seem to work properly for the majority of users. Google \"photostream apple tv 3 issues.\" My Apple TV recognized 268 photos out of about 700 I keep on Photostream, and will not recognize the others, despite updates and system resets. Do not get Apple TV for the Photostream feature, because there's no guarantee it will work.Netflix and other video applications work very well on the Apple TV - it streams 1080p content without a hitch (provided of course you have decent internet). Unfortunately, there are some serious issues with the Apple Remote. It's a great looking and feeling little device, but is not completely functional. For example, to change Netflix audio settings and subtitles, the Apple TV tells you to \"hold down the Select button.\" All that does is pause the video. In order to change these settings, you need to use the Remote App on your iPhone or iPad or iPod touch. Luckily that won't be a problem for most people, because so many households have one of those, but it's still an awfully annoying oversight. You can't watch Netflix videos with subtitles *unless* you use your other iOS device - and there are a number of similar, basic things you can't do without an iOS device.I'm keeping my Apple TV. I like what it does right - the interface, the aesthetics, and the functionality of iTunes Match (when it works), plus Airplay works well with my other devices. I could not recommend it to anyone who isn't willing to spend a few hours a month troubleshooting it. I really wish at this point that I had picked Google Music over iTunes Match, but since I didn't I'm willing to work with this sub-optimal device. If I wasn't reliant on iTunes I would switch to a Roku in a heartbeat, since they are vastly superior and easier to use in my experience.",

Looks like Blueray option was out due to too many complaints about connectivity..it was down to Appletv 3 or Roku 3.  I guess either would do..but I read a review somewhere stating the ApleTV had a more stable Wifi connectivity and thats what I needed.  My router was on the 2nd floor of the house and really needed wifi stability.Set-up was easy enough. Just turn on the unit/ plug it in and follow onscreen instructions.  Took a little while for the initial boot-up/ set-up.  Typing the password for the wifi set-up was a little challenging since I was not used todoing it via the remote (probably needs a keyboard accessory in the future)...and the typed character was converted to * after a few secs...so you really need to know your password.  It will rememebr the set-up after everything is set-up so you do this only once.  Just Be careful with the very small remote...very large chance to misplace it , specially with small kids using it.Comes with a lot of links (mostly need account with itunes) to purchase stuff...access to Youtube , podcasts, Smithsonian  and weather channel were free.Really need either a HULUplus or Netfilx subscription depending on what you regularly watch.  Beats paying $70++/ month for DirecTV which has 90% of the channels you dont watch....and clouds don't interfere with the signal.**NOTE: make sure the router is on first before you turn on the Appltv or else it will take a long time to do a re-set-up/ re-link to the router.***SO far it has been great, after a month of no huge cable/ satellite",

    "reviewText": "Initially, I was disappointed in the Apple TV (ATV). Every show, every item cost something! I felt I was on a budget airline. I originally purchased it because of an Internet article which stated that PBS was coming. What I saw after installation was old shows which wanted $1.99-$9.99 to watch.Then came an Internet update two days ago which added a PBS icon to the main screen. Now, everything under that icon is free! This is what I was expecting in the first place; I just didn't wait long enough, it seems. Although the resolution is not HD, it's OK. I still don't know how much of a lag there will be between actual broadcast and ATV availability (Downton Abbey, e.g.) but my impression of ATV has gone from one star to 4. I hope they introduce more free stuff.",

    "reviewText": "As the title hints, our household is already well furnished with Apple products. And as it has been said in other reviews in this thread, it will be a much more positive user experience for people who have Mac computers, or iPad / iPhone / iTouch, for these last three can be used as remote controls with an excellent free app (\"Remote\") from Apple.If it were not for Apple's attention to detail, the installation of the Apple TV could be a bear for less technology-savvy consumers. But, even though I've installed a network or five before, in my mind this couldn't have been easier. Opened up the package, plugged stuff up, and things came right up on the screen. Used the included remote to log in. It should be noted that logging in (This means you have to have an Apple ID login and password) must be done on all devices you plan on involving in what is essentially a kind of network parallel to the wi-fi network you have in your house (although of course it runs on it).You must log in, and turn on Home Sharing, on the Apple TV, in iTunes on any computer you're planning on using, and also on any  iPad / iPhone / iTouch you're using as a controller. It should also perhaps be noted that these logins are separate from logins and passwords you may be using for Netflix, Hulu, or any other media you are accessing through Apple TV. This all takes some time, but it's a one-shot deal.The nicest surprise (which I had not come across in my research) about the Apple TV is that it includes a high fidelity TOSLINK optical audio out connection in addition to the HDMI connector. The Sony receiver on our home stereo is rather old-school in that it predates HDMI, so we weren't going to be able to run the Apple TV signal through that. Instead, I'd have to run the HDMI cable directly to our Samsung HDTV. However, the receiver does have TOSLINK inputs, so I just use a cable I had lying around, and I have excellent sound through our stereo speakers.Once everything was up and running, I was very gratified by the far better picture and sound that I was getting compared to streaming Netflix through the Wii (which we have done for several years heretofore). I already knew that the Wii's specs for picture and sound were pretty low, but for me, the increase in performance alone was worth the price of the Apple TV and cable.Apple's attention to the end user experience has always been one of the best features of owning their products, but the icing on the cake for Apple TV is the \"Remote\" app. Free, simple, and elegant. Once I used it, I knew I'd have to put the included remote in a safe place, because I wouldn't be using it again except in some extraordinary circumstances.There are some complaints in the reviews that the Apple TV lacks certain online media services. This may be the case, but for what it does provide, and for how it performs, we are very pleased.Addendum: This Apple TV is just the gift that keeps on giving. I was under some misapprehensions about the capabilities of AirPlay, specifically AirPlay Mirroring. Google it, go to the Apple support page, and then do enough links. Photos and music may be displayed from your iDevice simultaneously through the Apple TV to your HDTV. Great!",

I was surprised that my library contained titles that my kids had put on their iPods years ago.  Digital Copy movies are accessible on all linked Apple ID accounts and devices.  No messy set up like UltraViolet.  No waiting for buggy apps like Flixster.  As usual, the Apple stuff simply works--simply.  I use it to rent movies.  The streaming works wonderfully, even with the TV in my house that is a ways from the WiFi source.  You can also stream mostly anything from your iPhone or iPad to the Apple TV device through AirPlay.  Think---pictures, home movies, YouTube, even presentations through Keynote (Apple's PowerPoint equivalent).

    "reviewText": "I purchased my first Apple TV a year ago.  Pretty much DOA out of the box.  It kept dropping the connection to iTunes.  It was impressed Tech support (US based, I think even in CA) answered the phone late Saturday afternoon, really knew his stuff, and was able to walk me through alot of different trouble shooting.  I learned many of the internet providers have a firewall system that interferes with the AppleTV, so the first thing we did was call AT&T; and reconfigure firewall setting.  BUST.  The second thing we did was try to update the hardware.  Since we couldn't connect long enough to complete the update, I had to go purchase a mini-USB cable (not included) to do a wired connection and update through iTunes.  BUST.  Keep in mind this took several weeks of troubleshooting and testing and retesting.  I was ready to throw in the towel.Tech finally suggested I had a bad unit and made an appointment for me the next day to go to the Apple store and swap it out.  The unit I received was new and had been tested by Apple and all the updates had already been installed for me.  Took it home and worked flawlessly just like I had expected it to when I first opened it several weeks prior.I will say I was very impressed with Apple's extensive service for a cheap $99 product.Over the year, my family has migrated more and more to the AppleTV and use it quite a bit.  My kids both asked for Apple TV's for Christmas, and I was able to ditch three U-Verse boxes.  With free HiDef broadcast TV, and all the options available on AppleTV, my kids are very happy.  The second and third Apple TV's I purchased worked flawlessly out of the box, have been running for over a month with moderate to heavy use and no issues.  They all connect to one iTunes account, which made setting all the parental controls super easy.My understanding is you can connect up to 8 AppleTV's to one iTunes account in one house.  I have found streaming movies lags when streaming three different AppleTV's at once, and I have 18mbps internet service.  We don't usually stream three movies at once, but I was curious to test the performance..I primarily purchased the AppleTV to manage the 2500+ mp4 movies I've collected and swapped with friends over the years.  I must admit I was not prepared for all of the extra features the AppleTV offers.The remote is not to my taste.  It's way too small and gets lost way to easily, especially with kids (- 1 star).  But any iPhone or iPad can control any AppleTV, and I can control any AppleTV from pretty much anywhere in the house, including sending live video to my kids TV's via Airplay.  (+1 star)the AppleTV remote must have a direct line of sight to the AppleTV to work.  You cannot tape it to the back of the TV and expect it to work.  It MIGHT if you have reflective walls, but you should have that expectation.  It is small, and some double sided tape worked real well mounting it to the top or bottom of some wall mounted flat screens.You can change the settings and remove icons/apps from the home screen that you don't want on there (customizable).You can set up parental controls and passwords to restrict content, compatible with MPAA ratings and US TV ratings.There is no Pandora app (yet), but we simply run Pandora from an iPhone or iPad and Airplay it to the AppleTV.",

    "reviewText": "Roku was and still is the most dependable, consistent, foolproof set-up with the most channels. For only fifty bucks, I don't see how you can beat it as the \"first\" choice for people seeking alternatives to cable, over-the-air programming, and DVD players.  In fact, both of my children's families have dropped cable and moved exclusively to Roku plus Netflix and Amazon for all of their needs.  My wife prefers cable and uses Roku for an occasional Netflix stream.That leaves me as the Apple TV guy, and this is the 2nd one I've purchased of Apple's 3 editions.  The box can be more temperamental than Roku, requiring the right settings on your computer and mobile devices, as well some limited knowledge about the device's interaction with iCloud and your various media libraries (iTunes will increase its usefulness)..  Also, the buyer should first be made aware that, unlike Roku, Apple TV does not give the user access to Amazon Prime services and features. Finally, for some reason each time I'm finished using Apple TV, I simply can't produce the necessary blinking \"start-up\" light the next time I use it unless I first go to the floor, unplug the device, wait a few seconds, then replug.  (It's probably good exercise for me, but some of us can be obsessive about ensuring that consumer media technology functions as flawlessly as its claims)  This 3rd generation Apple TV is far more reliable than my previous generation model, which eventually wouldn't even let me select \"Settings,\" but I was disappointed at the discovery that it would still require unplugging the device from AC before each use (maybe my \"unsmart\" TV is at fault).Unlike some, I don't require Apple TV simply to be able to hear my collection of music or to see my photos and movies in a room where there's a paired, compatible television set.  But I do find that the combination of the ITunes Store, with its vast holdings and resources, plus the availability of YouTube (not available on my Roku box), make up for the absence of Amazon content.  Moreover, I'm amazed at the effectiveness of \"Air Play\", which enables the user to \"mirror\" movies and videos on an iPod, iPad, or iPhone on a large TV screen--and in detail that's strikingly sharp.  (I would watch music videos streamed from Youtube all day long if it were my choice.)  One caveat: not all features are available to users who don't have Apple mobile devices or a computer with the iTunes program on it. Also, although I can \"mirror\" my computer's desktop onto my television set, the image is so dull I'm not inclined to use this feature.As for ChromeCast, it's far more limited in program content than either Roku or Apple TV and is, imo, fully valued, even at its current low price.  The ChromeCast device itself (which is nothing more than an extra-large thumb drive) was resistant to a secure HDMI connection in the back of my TV, and its attached short cord that must be plugged into a nearby USB port is a nuisance disproportionate to the reward.The best I can say for ChromeCast, when comparing it to the other two, is that it doesn't require a remote control (which is constantly getting lost).  I keep ChromeCast only for emergency use--should either of the other two boxes fail to access Netflix or \"throw\" a Youtube video on to my TV screen (which I rarely have time to watch--figuring out these gadgets takes up too much of it).  Some owners claim that Chromecast is the best of the three for \"multitasking.\"  Regardless, I'm happy to leave such activities to those who are more versatile than I.  Moreover, the device works best with computers that have Google's Chrome browser installed, and by habit I simply can't use anything other than Apple's Safari browser.",

    "reviewText": "This is a review of theApple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION]For the longest time, I was reluctant about getting an Apple TV since I have a TiVo box and a PC (not a Mac).  But, my brother told me one day how much he uses his, so I decided to give it a try.  I have an iPhone 4s, iPad 2 and an iPod Touch 4th Gen, so I use iTunes A LOT.  I have a rather extensive video collection amassing on my PC as well as close to 18,000 MP3s (all legal I might add).  The Apple TV really has changed the way I view TV now.  The seamless integration of all my various iOS devices with the Apple TV box is nothing short of spectacular.  It opens up the ability to start watching a movie on TV, then continuing the movie on the iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone.  Also, let's say you are out running errands and you are listening to music on your iPod, when you arrive at home, all you have to do is select Apple TV from the menu on the music player and Viola! You can listen to your music through your home entertainment system.  With all the features this little box offers, I now wonder why I ever hesitated to buy one.With the newest version of this box, you can now view streams in full 1080P HiDef. It also gives you access to the internet, so you can find out of town radio stations, your favorite YouTube or Vimeo videos, watch movies on Netflix, stream pictures to your TV with Flickr or PhotoStream, and lots of other cool and useful things.  Now, I know there are some people out there who think that a TiVo and negates te need for an Apple TV or, vice versa, but let me assure you, they are complimentary of each other.  With TiVo you can record shows off the TV and store them either on the TiVo box itself, or on a network-connected PC/Mac with the TiVo Desktop software.  The Apple TV allows you to stream all forms of multimedia from your computer or the internet.With Apple TV, the realm of digital media becomes more of a close reality.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys collecting movies, music, or any form of media, on the computer.  Or, if you just enjoy renting a movie for the weekend, this is for you too.  The selection is by far larger than any cable television's On Demand or Pay-Per-View content offerings.Not really a complaint, more of a suggestion for Apple.  The Apple TV can only be connected to one TV.  It would be great if it could be connected wirelessly to multiple TVs so you could watch your favorite shows in any room in your house, on any connected TV.",

My original thought was, even if I didn't like it, I can always jailbreak and install third party software on it.Connectivity and Netflix:It did not have any surprises, and the whole installation finished in 10-15 minutes--including wireless setup. I have a long WPA2 password, and that alone took an extra 5 minutes.  It connects to both 2 GHz and 5GHz channels on my Linksys E-4200 router without any problem. I immediately tested Netflix, and I was blown away by the interface, 1080P quality, and streaming speed of 8-12Mbps. I have a Sony BDP-S580 Blu-ray player that I used for streaming from Netflix, but Apple TV simply puts it into shame both in ease of use and speed. For this reason alone, I will keep this Apple TV. They really have thought about the user interface.I could not use the Apple TV to stream from my Synology DS212 NAS. It simply doesn't see the NAS. Synology has a music app that you can use to stream your music on Apple TV, but it doesn't support iTunes Home Sharing. I still could not find a decent way to stream movies from the Synology.Dual Screen (AirPlay) and Photo Stream:The dual screen or AirPlay is not too impressive for me. I like the share feature that you can send any YouTube or other videos to Apple TV, but the dual display is not that useful. Simply because the new iPad has an amazing Retina display that no LCD can come close to it. In addition, the dual display mode only works in 4/3 aspect ratio and not 16/9. Photo Stream works very well between Apple TV, iPhone 4s and the new iPad. I really enjoy this feature, and it uses your own photos as the screen saver.Problems: Only One!I have noticed that this new Apple TV does not support HDMI Control or CEC! I researched and found out that it has been a common problem in all Apple TV generations. Apparently, Apple doesn't like to support this mandatory standard.Conclusion:Considering the price, I will keep this new Apple TV. It is the best device for Netflix, and does a few more extra things. It is reassuring that you can always jailbreak and install third party software on it. At the moment, it doesn't do much with my current home network setup, but I am a satisfied customer. Thank you for reading this mini review.UPDATE (August 2013):It has been about 18 months since I got this ATV 3, and now even my TV has Netflix app. I rarely use this ATV, and since there is no jailbreak for version 3 so it can play XviD or DivX files, I wonder if Apple can keep up with the competition in the long run.",

This was a hassle because 1) you can't charge the iOS while it's streaming so you have to hope the battery's full or swap out the iPhone/iPad mid-show, and 2) HBO blocks the connection between an iOS & a projector, so if we wanted to watch HBOgo on the big screen, we'd have to reorganize the cables and connect a laptop.When FireTV announced the HBO parntership, I was psyched. Guess what -- even with the HDMI to VGA converter with R/L Audio Converter, the Fire TV will not work with a projector. So we got the AppleTV. It's not only compatible with our projector (using the converter we bought on Amazon), we found out we could stream HBOgo through our iOS wirelessly, which means it can be plugged into a power cable across the room.

Best $100 I ever spent.First off - you need an HDMI cable to hook it up that does not come in the box but if you're anything like us, you have extras. Right out of the box it was extremely easy to set up. I was reading some reviews about limited channels but I found that Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Pandora and iTunes is more than enough. There are more channels - but I have yet to check them out. We share an iTunes library with my husbands family so we have over $2000 worth of movies on this little guy. We also opted out of getting cable and use this for all of our shows.My husband and I both have iPhones as well and the Apple remote app is great! Works just like remote it comes with and its nice to have more than 1 remote we can use.I also have a MacBook and airplay is wonderful. Like I said we don't have cable but I do have a few shows that aren't on Hulu or Netflix like Catfish. So I go to MTV.com - find my episode, press the airplay symbol on my Mac and in like 12 seconds I'm streaming on my tv wirelessly.Could not be more impressed and I will definitely be getting a second one for our living room as well!",

Then I used AirPlay to stream a few videos from my iPhone 5. The video was excellent but the audio was choppy (it was also very choppy when I streamed songs from my Windows 7 desktop running iTunes using Home Sharing). This was a deal breaker for sure. I spent a few hours tweaking my wireless router configuration (Actiontec wireless router for Verizon FiOS) with no improvement. I was about to pack up the Apple TV and send it back when I remembered that it had an optical audio output on the back. I connected the optical cable directly to my Onkyo receiver and voila! No more choppy audio. Seems the problem is with my Samsung HDTV panel and not the Apple TV (audio path was Apple TV -&#62; HDMI -&#62; Samsung HDTV -&#62; optical cable -&#62; Onkyo receiver). Now I can say without a doubt that the Apply TV absolutely ROCKS! Excellent video quality, excellent audio quality (now)... love Netflix streaming with this device too. Last night my wife and I used the AirPlay feature to stream a rented movie from our iPad 3 to the Apple TV... played perfectly and without any issues. Today I've been streaming Netflix, HBO GO, and even Amazon Prime videos (from my iPhone 5) without any issues. I've even used AirPlay on my MacBook Pro to display my desktop on the Apple TV. At this point I can safely say that I've put it through its paces (AirPlay via iPhone 5, iPad 3, MacBook Pro, and Netflix and HBO GO via internal apps, and iTunes streaming from iTunes Match (both music and radio) with excellent results. I'm 100% satisfied because it does everything so well and effortlessly.",

    "reviewText": "Just like other reviews have said, the full utility of the Apple TV (aTV) really depends on whether you have already bought into the Apple eco-system or plan to in the future. To determine if the aTV would fit my family's needs, I did my research, but I had to search mutiliple websites to answer my questions. This review is aimed at providing all the information I wanted to know before I pulled the trigger on this purchase.First, a word on my previous entertainment setup/usage. I had aApple Mac Mini MC270LL/A Desktopused as a Home Theatre PC to a Samsung 1080p TV with an additionalSony BDP-BX38 Blu-ray Player Wi-Fi Ready / Internet Appsthat was given to us. However, most of our movies were bought from iTunes and stored on anIomega MiniMax FireWire 800/USB 2.0 1TB Desktop External Hard Drive 34937 (White). Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you can start to mentally see the clutter around our TV. We used this setup to primarily watch Netflix from the Safari browser and Hulu (free version) from Hulu Desktop - throw in a spot of Youtube on the side. As mentioned earlier, movies (and music) would be rented or purchased from iTunes. Even though the Blu-Ray player has Internet Apps such as Netflix, Hulu+, Pandora, Amazon video, etc; it wasn't used much at all, except for the odd DVD/Blu-Ray disc somebody loaned to us. However, when the Blu-Ray player was given to us, they forgot to remove their Hulu+ (paid version) account information, and we got introduced to the full glory of Hulu+ (it was nice to go watch past episodes for shows we discovered three seasons in). My wife and I both have an iPhone and iPad each, but we have no other laptops/desktops besides the Mac Mini.Footprint:Even though Apple's website has numerous pictures of the aTV, I was still very much surprised by how small this thing is. The official size is 3.9 inches wide by 3.9 inches deep by 0.9 inches high, and I even read multiple reviews that it was literally the size of a hockey puck, but I still stood amazed at how compact, sleek, and sexy this little black device was. The aTV replaced the Mac Mini, external hard drive, keyboard, and mouse. My wife could not be happier at the reduced \"nerd clutter\".Setup:Many reviews have talked about the ease in setup, so I won't belabor the point. Just know that like all things Apple, the aTV \"just works\" out of the box. Plug it in, type in your wifi, iTunes, and Netflix information and you're set to go.Remote:Apple always goes with a minimalist design, but I'm always concerned that anything \"minimalist\" will lack strength and functionality. I'm the type of guy that will use a 4x4 post to hang a bird feeder. However, this minimalist remote feels solid in my hand. My fingers wrap around perfectly, and the buttons have a solid response and feel. I can scroll through Netflix adding movies to my queue for hours without fatigue or risk of carpal tunnel. Additionally, the Apple Remote app works flawlessly and is really put together well. There may even be a lot of people who use the app as the primary remote, since it works so well. For me, there will be no more spending 30 minutes trying to find where the 2 year-old stole the remote off to, since my iPhone/iPad can seemlessly step in until the remote turns up 3 days later. Some people may also be pleased to know the oldApple - Apple Remote remote controlcan work as well, and for the more budget minded people, can be a cheap replacement/backup. I will say searching for content with the remote can be cumbersome. You have to move the remote cursor to each letter to spell out words. You can get pretty quick at it, but it is not the same as a regular keyboard. Unfortunately, the Apple Remote app for the iPhone/iPad won't allow you to use its keyboard to aide in the process. Unless you are willing to jailbreak (which currently there is no jailbreak for the aTV 3), you learn to be more efficient like searching for a TV show once, and additing it to your instant queue in Netflix or adding it to your favorites in iTunes. While a minor convienence, it doesn't effect my rating of the product.Navigation:Like most people, I'm looking for ease of use. I don't want to navigate through 10 submenus before finding information on a movie to press the back button 10 times to look at another movie. This was the downfall of the internet apps on my Blu-Ray player. The aTV home screen is setup with app icons like on the iPhone/iPad, making navigation between the apps simple. The implementation of the Netflix app is quite user friendly. I like it much better than using Netflix's website from the Mac Mini. The iTunes store is the same friendly user experience. You can quickly scan different movies, read a synopses, and move on. If you are looking at an Adam Sandler movie, you are one click away from seeing the other Sandler movies available on iTunes. The whole menu system is awesomely designed to quickly find a movie or TV show and start watching.Movies from the Cloud:I hated standing in front of the TV looking through DVDs only to find the DVD I wanted to watch wasn't in the case, and finding it 3 days later sitting next to the remote. With the mac mini, I stored all my movies on an external harddrive. While this added another piece of \"nerd clutter\", all my movies were readily accessable whenever I wanted. aTV takes this a step further: All your iTunes purchases are available through iCloud. Anything you have purchased via iTunes on a particular account can be streamed over the Internet to your aTV, so no need for a harddrive. In fact, I was quite surprised to find 3 movies that I had bought 6 years ago, that I had completely forgotten about. I bought them on a laptop that had crashed, and I assumed the movies were gone forever. However, iTunes kept up with that purchase, and it was quite the nice surprise when the aTV started streaming them for my lost enjoyment. These streamed movies take about as long as a Netflix movie to load and start playing (only a few seconds with my internet connection). Also, you can purchase additional movies and TV shows from the iTunes store directly from your aTV, and know they are safely stored in the cloud for your progeny to enjoy.iTunes Home Sharing:Also, if you have a laptop/desktop computer on your network with movies/music stored in your iTunes library, then you can stream these over your network to your aTV. This takes less time to start playing than if you are streaming from the cloud, but honestly, I find the cloud so convenient, that I don't use this option much except for playing music from one of our playlists. To me, the difference in load time is negligible. However, this is the only option to play music in your iTunes library, unless you have paid for iTunes Match which will allow you to stream iTunes purchases from the cloud. Also, if you have ripped any DVD's to your computer, then iTunes Home Sharing is your only option to stream to your aTV. But when needed, it works well.Content:The aTV certainly doesn't have the same amount of content as the Roku or even my Blu-Ray player. For internet content, the aTV is limited to Netflix, Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, MLB.TV, NBA, NHL, and WSJ. Most of these speak for themselves, but I would like to expand upon MLB.TV. Now, I enjoy baseball, and Altanta Braves games is one thing I have missed since we got rid of cable 5 years ago when we got the Mac Mini. MLB.TV blacks out the Braves games since I'm so close to Atlanta, but I would probably be too cheap to pay the subscription price even if that wasn't the case. However, even without the subscription, MLB.TV will stream a 2-3 minute Sports Center-like recap of the games. I know it isn't the same, but it is more than I've had for 5 years, and I'm exstatic. The main gripe I've read about content is the lack of Amazon Instant Video on the aTV. I'm an Amazon Prime member, so I get the unlimited streaming videos. Even though the aTV lacks Amazon support (or even a iPhone/iPad app that I can mirror to the aTV), I'm not too upset. Amazon's library is not very large, and the movies they do have (that I would actually watch) are 99% of the time on Netflix too. If Amazon continues to develope their Instant Video library, then this may become more of an inconvience. This really comes down to whether you are an iTunes user or an Amazon instant video user. If the latter, and you have bought movies from Amazon Instant Video, then the Roku or similar device is for you. The other main gripe is lack of Hulu+, I'll address that below in the Hulu paragraph.AirPlay/Mirroring:If you have an iPhone and/or iPad, there is no excuse for not having an aTV. The Aiplay/Mirroring feature is amazing. I can display my iPhone/iPad screen up through my aTV onto my HDTV. You will be surprised just how useful this is. Say I was reading the news on my iPad and found a video of San Diego mucking up their 4th of July fireworks display, I can Airplay the video to the TV, and my wife and I can laugh in unison. When I go out of town for a business trip, my wife can mirror her Facetime video onto the aTV, so the kids can all see me on the \"big screen\" without having to squeeze themselves around the \"small screen\". Another useful feature, is if you prefer searching for videos on your iPhone/iPad, then you can open up Netflix (or similar apps that support Airplay) find the video you want to watch and Airplay it to the aTV. Now there is a difference between Aiplay and Mirroring. Airplay is used by apps that have been specifically designed to use the Airplay feature (many of Apple's apps do this) and fill up your TV screen. Mirroring will only put a mirroed video iPhone/iPad screen. This will only be in 4:3 aspect ratio, so you have these black bars on the left and right of the screen. But Mirroring is surprisingly responsive with hardly any noticeable lagging. I have found a mirad of uses for Airplay/Mirroring. You will not be disappointed.Hulu+:Mirroring can be combursome for watching lots of videos. This is one of the reasons why it took me so long to buy an aTV. With the gift of Hulu+ on the Blu-Ray player, I realized that this was a feature I wanted, but the aTV didn't have Hulu+ built in, and Mirroring would only play a 4:3 video of it, and not utilize my entire TV. So I waited. My patience was awarded on May 21, 2012, when Hulu released version 2.5 of their Hulu+ app for the iPhone and iPad. The update improved Airplay Mirroring to stream a 16:9 video to your aTV. It almost fills my entire TV, leaving only about a 1.5 inch black bar around the borders on my 55 inch TV. It was difficult to find information on whether this new implementation was good or not. I can certify that Hulu's update solved the problem, and Hulu+ mirrored from my iPhone/iPad to my aTV is a great solution. I enjoy sitting on my couch browsing my queue in Hulu+ then sending it to the aTV for the family to watch. The video is crisp and responsive. It is a pleasure to use. For those wondering, I do have my own Hulu+ account now, and am happy to pay the subscription fee.***UPDATE 2 Aug 2012***Apple pushed down a software update, and now Hulu+ is natively supported on the aTV. It has it's own appp icon right next to Netflix on the home screen. While I didnt mind aiplaying Hulu+ from my iPhone, the native app is more convenient. Initial impressions are Apple has done a good job. It is intuitive and easy to use. You can even sign up for Hulu+ directly from the aTV. If Hulu+ was a hang up for you on getting an aTV and my original review didn't sway you... Well now you have no excuses.Pure Speculation:Given the rumors of the iTV, I think Apple has more in store for the aTV. It is way too much for Apple to expect everyone to buy a whole new TV to get their new features/content. To overcome those user's who won't pay $2K for a new TV, I think all the new wiz-bang features will be offered in an aTV software update. If the rumors are right, that could be as soon as this year. And if I'm right, there will be a mad rush to buy aTV's, and I'll be glad not to have to fight lines at the Apple Store or waiting 2 weeks on backorders. Again, this is pure speculation, and this review will either be prophetic or be my shame.Summary:If you aren't an Apple-fanboy, the aTV still has a lot to offer. This is a must have item if you are already in the Apple eco-system, but is useful for those people only looking to cut their cable bill because of widespread internet content, and it is much cheaper than a HTPC. My advice mirrors other reviewer's. Know what you expect your purchase to do, and determine if a particular product meets your needs. The aTV does this for me in spades, but it additionally has the user friendly experience that Apple provides.",

    "reviewText": "Owning both a Roku and AppleTV I would say both things do certain things well. One of the reasons that AppleTV only gets a four star rating and not a five star rating is because I feel that with Apple's resources they should be well ahead of Roku.Where AppleTV really shines is syncing with your home computer. Being able to listen to music stored on my computer in my living room, and being able to control it with my phone using the nifty remote app is where AppleTV shines. The Youtube integration is also a great feature on AppleTV. I love how Apple TV displays the album covers of the music I'm listening to on my television screen. Cover art has never looked better.Apple TV also allows you to mirror what's on your iPad or iPhone on to your TV screen. This is great for photos but when using it with things like Slingplayer it was horrible. My slingplayer app got no picture and other apps such as HBO GO are completely blocked. I mirrored some of my music on my iPad and noticed a huge drop in quality from the music that was played from home sharing. Not sure why.Both of these devices offer netflix however the Roku also adds many more channels such as Amazon On Demand, which I would argue is far better than the movies app on Apple TV.  Roku also offers HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Crackle which are not offered on Apple TV, however Apple TV has YouTube which Roku doesn't. There is a channel that you can download for Roku called RateRix that allows you to watch all your bookmarked youtube videos however this channel is such a pain to use that it isn't even worth the free download.There's another app called Plex that I have on my Roku which isn't the easiest app in the world to use however it supports a lot more video than Apple TV does and one of my videos that was an MKV file played fine in iTunes but on AppleTV it didn't have any sound whereas with Plex the sound worked perfectly and was in sync with the video.  Plex also allows you to access your iTunes library on your Roku, however the user experience isn't quite up to par as it is with AppleTV.If you don't want to download the plex channel on your Roku, the Roku offers a USB port which allows me to download movies to a Flash drive and simply insert them into my Roku. This is not offered on AppleTVI would say both of these have features the other lacks, however where Apple dropped the ball in my opinion is not having an App store like they do with the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.  Roku shouldn't even be in business, much less providing competition for Apple.If I had to pick I would go with the Roku, however the AppleTV does some very cool things that Roku doesn't such as YouTube and while both will allow you to access your entire music library, the AppleTV does a significantly better job at this than Roku. On the other hand Roku has a lot more apps, and I would argue better apps.",

You should go to itunes and download the free Remote for iOS app before setting it all up.  Also the way to &#34;mirror&#34; what you see on your ipad is supported by enabling the Home Sharing section under the Computer icon on apple tv.  Also, in order to see your control for Airplay on your ipad place your finger on the bottom of your screen and swipe up fast and it'll bring up your Airplay control panel so you can start mirroring things from the device to the TV.

    "reviewText": "It's simple out of the box but be aware you will need to purchase HDMI and ethernet cables on your own.  This comes with power cord only.  Truly a plug and play device. One of the simplest, trouble free electronic devices I've ever utilized.  Plug in power. Plug in ethernet or connect wireless.  Run HDMI to TV or reciever. That's it.  The device will power itself up and walk you through a quick set up screen. It will be easier if you have created an iTunes account already. Updates will download w/in the first several minutes hooking it up.I won't go into a lot of detail about the icons/apps as they are well explained here and other places.  The UI is user friendly and easy to navigate using the small, sleek remote control.  The only one I've really played with so far is Netflix which connected to my account using just user name and pw. Didn't have to run up to the home computer and register the device to my NF account. Very easy. Unless you subscribe to iTunes Match ($25/yr.) you must have the iTunes program open on your device before it will stream iTunes content through your TV. If you pay for Match then you can pull all that out of the cloud and won't need to have your imac, iphone or ipad running.Probably the favorite feature everyone wants to hear about, and the reason I purchased the box to begin with is Air Play Mirroring.  You must be running Mountain Lion on your mac or have ios6 (I think) on your phone or pad.  Additionally your Mac needs to be a relatively recent build; mid 2011 and up I believe running the i5 Intel chip. Your device will automatically detect an apple tv box on the network and produce an icon for you to click.  This occurs in two places:  there is an icon on the bottom of the iTunes program which if clicked will push video and audio from w/in iTunes to your TV.  The other one is located in your main tool bar somewhere (on my imac this is the top right corner of screen). Activating that will push web mirroring to your TV.  I did a quick Google search to figure out which settings are best. Under resolution select \"Best for Airplay\" and deselect \"Overscan Correction\".  Initially I had some issues with the whole herky, jerky, stop-motion effect. Again a Google search for \"Mirroring Stuttering\" or \"Mirroring Freezing\" will take you to many solution pages.  There are many psbl. fixes but these seem to be the most common and worked for me:  make sure you have a true N band, dual antannae router with most up to date firmware. Use the 5Ghz band. In your router advanced settings deselect \"WMM Enabled\" under the QoS-Quality of Service-tab. Have the router as close to the apple box as you can. Turn off other apps and limit other usage on your network. Obviously high speed internet is necessary. Once I adjusted for all that the picture came in quite clear--not quite HD or bluray but definitely as good as or better than SD signals. Every now and then a few screen pixelations and minor stuttering will occur but nowhere near the extent as before the tweaks. Also volume had to be turned up quite high on my receiver before audio sounded good. The play/pause button on the remote will not stop and start video so if you need a break you'll have to control that from the device that's being mirrored.  Ultimately this is really a fantastic bit of technology though future updates will hopefully make it even better. There's all kinds of free streaming services from TV to movies to clips etc. that can now be viewed from the comfort of a couch on your big screen. This is why I bought the box and it has delivered satisfactorily.Biggest downside I have to comment on has nothing to do w/ Apple or the box. I chose Amazon free shipping and they took their sweet time getting it to me. I always use the free shipping when offered and usually still have the product w/in a week or so.  They didn't even ship this box the first week. Then once shipped it took another week getting to me. Pretty ridiculous but free so little room to complain I guess. Still annoying.  If you have high speed internet and a mirroring capable device I don't see how you can go wrong getting the Apple TV box for less than 100 bucks. Well worth it.EDIT:  Figured out the volume issue during mirroring.  Need to make sure the volume on your mac, phone or tablet is all the way up which I thought mine was. Turns out it was turned way down and once adjusted sound through the receiver speakers was just fine.EDIT #2:  12/8/2012.  With the iTunes 11 update the AirPlay mirroring icon in that program is now at the top of the window on the left side near the Song Title bar.  Also just had difficulty with an update last week.  Google search indicated many others having similar troubles trying to get the update via ethernet.  The fix is to disconnect ethernet and get the update wirelessly...then reconnect ethernet cable when completed.",

    "reviewText": "Quite frankly, the Apple TV is the most used consumer electronic device in our house, by far. Surprisingly even more than the TV, to which it is attached, because we stream music directly to it as well, without turning on the TV. It' almost always on, either playing music, showing photos or playing TV shows and movies. We have decided a few years ago that we switch all our electronic devices to Apple products because they can work together so seamlessly. The Apple TV is something like the window to everything Apple; this is the ultimate presentation device. It has access to all our devices and can play or display pretty much all the content we ever purchased/downloaded/created, straight on the big screen.It's super easy to use and the interface is fast and responsive. We own a Samsung TV and a Samsung Blu-ray player, both of which actually have access to Netflix and other online services built-in, but boy ... you don't want to use them, believe me. They are laggy, ugly, have horrific user interface design, bad image quality and crash all the time. Since we don't have a cable box and we don't watch live TV, the TV is just a dumb box that displays the Apple TV's picture. The Blu-ray player is only used to play Blu-rays and DVDs occasionally.True, content on the Apple TV costs money: Netflix, iTunes, etc. However, if you are an adult with a job who otherwise spends over a $100 on cable TV, then the Apple TV suddenly becomes the potent alternative as an on-demand video box and gateway to all the content you already own.A couple of words about the changes between the old and the new Apple TV 2. The new one obviously has higher picture resolution (1080p) but even more importantly the rented and purchased iTunes (and Netflix) contents are also encoded in much better image quality. I wouldn't really notice the increased resolution, but the improved compression definitely makes it a worthy upgrade.Frankly, I don't agree with people who complain about the user interface changes. I think the new interface is easier to use, especially inside the Movies or TV Shows menu, where the submenus are readily available in the pop-up menu on the top of the screen.",

    "reviewText": "This is an elegant and easy to use little box.  The interface is pretty, setup is dead simple (took less than 10 minutes from start to finish), and it's fairly intuitive to use.  The problem comes in that it doesn't serve a great deal of function, at least for me.Apple TV is essentially 3 main functions in one package.  iTunes front end, content/channel provider, and wireless display.On the face of it, Apple TV is a front end for iTunes and allows you to buy or rent content and view it on the box along with previously purchased content.  The usefulness of this is based on where you buy content.  If it's not iTunes then you can ignore most of it.  All the magic from this perspective is essentially gone for videos and even music doesn't work without iTunes Match.  You can alternatively access your media from another computer currently running iTunes, but only the content in iTunes (not a huge issue) and again, only when the computer is on and running (think of it like an iTunes extender).  The interface is lush and a joy to use but it's dependency on iTunes purchases or iTunes running on a computer diminishes the usefulness.  It'd be nice it it could access a network attached storage or something similar.The other content means are provided through channels/apps, like on a Roku box, but are limited to only 13.  Missing are the normal heavy hitters: Hulu Plus, HBO Go, Pandora, Slacker, Spotify, etc.  Only Netflix is present really, but what device doesn't have access to that?  I have 3 other devices connected to my receiver that can do it already and personally prefer the PS3 Interface.  The general feel of the channel/apps is also very smooth and works fast but some of them feel a bit long in the tooth, as if it could be better but in order to fit the overall design scheme it's not (again Netflix is an example).The final feature is AirPlay.  This is a feature that allows you to stream music and video from your MacOS and iOS device.  There's also AirPlay mirroring which takes what you see on your device (or computer once Mountain Lion is out) and puts it on the Apple TV.  It seems, based on the packaging, Apple is trying to play this up a lot and I'd agree with that goal.  It's really simple and amazing to use where it works (certain applications don't support it or actively block it).  If you're familiar with Intel's WiDi it's a very similar thing, especially with AirPlay mirroring.  Certain things work better with Airplay though (Slingplayer and Netflix, for example, display the controls on iOS while the video is on the TV) and others not so well (Hulu, for example, doesn't support video out - only mirroring.  HBOGo is blocked entirely, mirroring or video out).  It works really well and is very smooth with minimal lag with audio and experiences only occasional minor choppiness with video provided you're on 802.11N or have the apple tv wired (had bad problems with quality over two G routers).  The same, however, can't be said for AirPlay compatible games like Asphalt 6, which due to lag/stuttering is near unplayable (the jittering and stuttering mean you'll miss too much with fast paced games, e.g. In Asphalt you'll crash).Your enjoyment of this device will depend directly on the amount you give yourself to Apple, more specifically iTunes.  If you don't use iTunes for content purchase at least 1/3 of the functionality is right out the window.  And if you own a PS3, Xbox, TiVo, Wii, Roku, Google TV, certain Blu-Ray players, or even a smart TV then there's no point to the channels/apps really.  No MacOS or iOS devices and there's no point to the AirPlay aspect.  However if you're a diehard Apple fan and have lots of money spent in iTunes, this will be amazing, I'm sure of it.That's not to say it's not without its pleasure, the device is a joy to use.  I find myself wanting to listen to music from my TV just to look at the lush interface that's so simple and yet gorgeous.  But, for all of Apple's shine and improvements to the device, they've failed to address the largest issue - lack of content options.  Without more channels/apps like Netflix (looking at you Hulu, HBO, etc) Apple TV ultimately suffers from limited usability unless you're a big iTunes fan.  While it's fair that a good percentage of people looking at this device will have some content in iTunes, Apple simply cannot rely on that to support this product alone.  Features like AirPlay are a welcome addition but likely aren't enough.  Especially considering that video playback is a bit choppy and mirroring, especially with games, has too much lag.For me personally, I'm really only left with the AirPlay feature as a big feature.  Which alone might be worth the price, especially if Apple can improve the performance.  The content/channels/apps are, even objectively, poor.  And the dependency on iTunes either running or being used for content purchases diminishes the utility of the media for me leaving the \"Movies\", \"TV Shows\", and \"Music\" features as empty.  Yes it does everything the previous Apple TV did but better, but that's also it's flaw - it doesn't do anything new.Pros:++ Simple set up++ Very pretty and smooth interface++ AirPlay (for music and video)+ 1080PCons:-- Very limited channels/content-- iTunes only for content, even for in network- iTunes match dependent for music- AirPlay lags and stutters a bit too much with mirroring and gamesThings I'd like to see:1) Support for network storage for content streaming.  You can jailbreak and put plex or xmbc on to do this, but why do I have to?2) More channels/apps.  I've got all the missing channels on my iPad but why not on the Apple TV?  Especially annoying since this is based off iOS 5 and has hardware better or on par with the original iPad.3) Stronger AirPlay performance. (yes it's wired in, but it still stutters for games)In the end it does really well at what it does (most of the time) but it's a very shallow pool.COMPARISON TO ROKU 2:I also own a Roku 2 XS, so I figured I'd update with some remarks in comparison.  The Apple TV is notably easier to set up.  The Apple TV interface is also generally better, however certain apps (specifically looking at Netflix) while smoother on Apple TV are better laid out on Roku.  Specifically with that, I mean Apple TV forces a text list strong interface at front whereas Roku shows you the box art.  The remote on the Apple TV feels better but is more limited than Roku (Roku XS is RF as opposed to IR on Apple TV) and also lacks the instant replay (10 second) button found on the Roku XS - very handy at times.  Both are limited with text entry but have smartphone/tablet apps for use (although Apple Remote is only on iOS devices, whereas Roku Remote is on Android and iOS - a point to note, but not likely a deal breaker).  Image quality is comparable, Apple TV works better wirelessly than the Roku though (especially at start).  While Apple's interface is generally better/faster/smoother, it still ultimately lacks in content when compared to Roku.  Roku has Pandora, HBO Go, Hulu, Amazon Instant, Crackle, and many other options.  Aside from iTunes content (either from your computer or iTunes cloud for movies/tv or iTunes Match) there isn't anything I'm aware of that Apple TV has that Roku does not.  Apple TV does have AirPlay, which again makes it nice.While Apple TV interface is generally better and smoother, the cost of the Roku (I got the XS for $80, so 20% less) and the instant replay button make it a better option for streaming.  It's not as refined but it offers the heavy hitters missing from Apple TV.  Streaming options are just better with Roku.Unless you own an iOS device or will be upgrading to Mountain Lion (for AirPlay) or are heavily invested in iTunes store purchases - Roku is better hands down as Apple TV's use will be very very limited.  Conversely if you already own a gaming console or a TiVo or something similar then the streaming options of the Roku may not be unique (between my tivo, ps3, and 360 - there isn't a thing I use the roku for that I can't do on one of those - mainly the PS3).  If you're interested in a streaming device and don't already own a gaming console, Roku is likely better.  If you are only interested in Netflix, MLB, and NHL and/or you're really in love with iTunes or AirPlay, then Apple TV is better.Personally? I'm keeping the Apple TV, for AirPlay alone, hooked up to my TV in the living room.  The Roku is going in my guest room.  The Roku is a better device in my opinion, but it doesn't do anything unique like AirPlay.  Perfect on it's own though where I don't want to buy several devices again.  Apple TV though is much much limited on its own though.UPDATE:I've tried other AirPlay games (Real Racing 2, NFS Shift 2) and the performance is better on these games.  It's still not what I'd expect or really want to deal with but it's playable for sure.  Lag/stuttering happens less often and when it does it's less severe as compared to Asphalt 6.  I'll note as well that the performance doesn't have an appreciable difference when the Apple TV is wireless vs wired, so it's unclear what's contributing to the lag.  But the fact that some games are doable gives me hope for the future.UPDATE 2:Hulu was added - Huzzah!  We're getting closer and closer.I'd recently bought a MBA and have used the Apple TV for AirPlay when trying to show a video to someone.  It works well but occasionally refuses to work correctly - either the video is funny or there is no audio.  Requires a restart of the MBA to get working (so it's possible the error is on the MBA side).All in all I still enjoy and use this device but it's only used for AirPlay for me.  If you don't own other Apple products or don't intend to use AirPlay I still say your money is better spent on an Roku.  I'm still going to leave this as a 3 star review for me.  Again it's gained more features but not enough in my mind yet.  It's close to a 4 though, but the dependency on iTunes and other Apple devices to be anything unique keeps it down.  Feels more like it's supposed to be an accessory for Apple products, not a device to itself so much.  Which is fine, but then I'd expect better performance.UPDATE 3 (Final Update):So taking a look back on this after nearly two years of ownership.  Things have improved content wise - HBO Go is there, Disney and a few other channels have appeared as well.  But for all of content improvements they've still ignored the larger flaws while the improvements to competing devices (notably Roku and WD) and the introduction of the Chromecast manage to further highlight the flaws and shortcomings of the Apple TV.  There's still no NAS support and most services that could compete with Apple's iTunes (Pandora, Spotify, Rdio, Amazon Instant) are still missing and likely will be for the foreseeable future.The Apple TV interface, while simple, is becoming stale and ugly in a few applications (YouTube and Netflix jump to mind).  Roku has drastically improved their interface, bettering Apple as far as I'm concerned.  All the while the Chromecast has come on to the scene and for $35 does many comparable things (including whole screen casting similar to AirPlay from laptops - although admittedly not as smooth yet).Now, more than ever, the value proposition of Apple TV is largely tied to you and your participation in Apple's ecosystem.  If you need iTunes access or your need AirPlay, this is the only device to get them on.  But if you don't, there's really not any reason I can provide to buy an Apple TV anymore.  Even a year ago you could make the argument that if all you needed was Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube hat the Apple TV was as good option thanks to its attractive interface but since Roku has fixed their interface with the Roku 3 this simply isn't the case anymore; the Roku is now the box to beat.  The additional content channels provided by Apple TV do help its use, but it seems more apparent that they're deliberately leaving out competing services (or at least that those services have no interest being on Apple TV).  So if you use Pandora, Spotify, Amazon Instant, and several other services you have to get something else (for now at least).I'm not saying Apple TV is a terrible device, I still have mine hooked up in my living room for AirPlay.  But if you exclude iTunes and AirPlay there's simply no reason to buy it over a Roku or WD TV or Chromecast anymore really.  While iTunes and AirPlay are valuable features I could argue that the absence of Amazon Instant, Vudu, Spotify, Pandora, and Slingplayer are notable weaknesses that other platforms don't have. So in the end it really is based on your ecosystem needs.  If you're heavily invested into Apple's world and can do without the missing services then by all means get an Apple TV.  But in nearly any other instance your money is better spent elsewhere.",

    "reviewText": "I want to start this review by stating that I am not an Apple elitist. I prefer and love my PC so I will give my best unbiased review of the AppleTV. My reason for buying the AppleTV was three fold: (1) I wanted the ability to integrate my home theater system with my computer media (music, movies, and photos) both wired and wirelessly, (2) I wanted to project what I was doing on my iPad to my television for guests to see without having to look over one persons shoulder, and (3) I wanted to easiest user interface for both my family and guests to be able to use without needing assistance.With those three items in mind, the AppleTV has met each one of my needs. It has the functionality of streaming internet videos as well through Netflix, YouTube, etc... but those are all just icing on the cake. As far as the hardware product itself, the newest version of the AppleTV has added the functionality of 1080p which is why I waited to purchase the newest model. Apple was behind the market in this category as other competitor products had 1080p capabilities long before. A quick rundown:Pros:(1) The accessibility of integrating your entire home theater system with your personal media collection from your computer or iPad.(2) The ability to mirror the iPad display for everyone to see on the TV.(3) The ease of the user interface for first time users.(4) As a plus, the size of the product is extremely small and easy to install. Only requires a power outlet and an HDMI cable.Cons: Apple's locked down software only allows for videos in your iTunes account to be viewed on the AppleTV. Knowing that before I purchased, I did not take away a star.Summary: I knew what I was getting before I made my purchase of the new AppleTV and it did not disappoint. In fact, because of the ease of installation, use of interface, and quality build of product it has met and in some ways exceeded my expectations. I await the day when the PC market will produce similar products with superior user interfaces.",
