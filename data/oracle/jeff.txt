The burner was easy to install, and is easy to use, and does the job the sales literature said it would.
I would definitely give this product 5 starts but the level of noise it produce during work seems slightly excessive.
I just bought this drive - it came bundled with Nero v6.6 which DOES NOT work with Windows Vista.
I give it only 1 star because I have too!Upon connecting the item and loading the software, my computer worked for one day and then completely crashed.
Super easy to operate.

Let me tell you, if you are looking for a camera with a good photo quality and video, this is it
It goes through batteries in about 10 minutes of photography.
admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get.
The Powershot A300 is a good beginner's digital camera and the price is fairly decent.
lightly bulkier that I'd like, but it's a Canon at a reasonable price.

it's not the best ever, but for the $$ it is tremendous.
It replaces a tiny Sony speaker, that, while adequate in many ways, was just not cutting it in the center.
If you are a movie lover, do yourself a favor and get a nice center channel like this one.
Oh yeah, thats another thing - this baby is loud, but thats a Cerwin Vega trademark.
I'm convinced it would be hard to buy a better speaker without paying much more money for it and most of us would mot be able to hear the difference between the two.
