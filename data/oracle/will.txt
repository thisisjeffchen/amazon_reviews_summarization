It was easy to connect to the computer and install the provided software.
Playback is excellent with either connection - Firewire or USB.
Packaged software is poor.
I so far like the drive, my major complaint is the Nero software that came with it, I've had nothing but aggravation with it!
The DVD Recorder works well and does what it is supposed to do.

Excellent Value for money.
Cheap piece of junk.
Great first digital camera.
Consumes lots and lots of battery power.
If I asked anyone else to take a picture with the camera, I had to specifically warn them because this camera is UNUSUALLY slow.

Great center channel speaker
Great quality center speaker for the price!
The sound coming out of this speaker is crisp, clean and clear.
This speaker is very loud and clear with just the right amount of bass.
This really made a difference in hearing vocals on movies.
